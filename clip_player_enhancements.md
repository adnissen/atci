# Clip Player Enhancements

## Summary of Changes

The clip player template has been enhanced with transcript rendering and navigation functionality as requested.

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend Changes (Controller)

**File**: `lib/autotranscript/web/controllers/transcript_controller.ex`

- Modified the `clip_player` function to load transcript data from the corresponding `.txt` file
- Added transcript data to the template context, making it available to the frontend

### 2. Frontend Changes (Template)

**File**: `lib/autotranscript/web/controllers/transcript_html/clip_player.html.heex`

#### A. Added Navigation Buttons
- Added "Previous marker" and "Next marker" buttons for both start and end time fields
- Buttons are positioned above the time input fields
- Styled with consistent dark theme design

#### B. Added Transcript Display
- Conditionally renders the transcript content below the form
- Displays in a scrollable container with proper styling
- Only shows when transcript data is available

#### C. Added JavaScript Functionality
- **Transcript Parsing**: Parses transcript data to extract timestamps using regex pattern `(\d{2}:\d{2}:\d{2}\.\d{3})`
- **Timestamp Conversion**: Converts HH:MM:SS.mmm format to seconds
- **Navigation Logic**: 
  - Finds next/previous timestamps relative to current start/end times
  - Updates button states (enabled/disabled) based on availability of next/previous markers
- **Event Handlers**: 
  - Button click handlers update the corresponding time fields
  - Navigation buttons update after time field changes
  - Automatic button state updates when page loads

## Key Features

1. **Transcript Accessibility**: Full transcript is now rendered and accessible to the frontend
2. **Smart Navigation**: Navigation buttons automatically find the next/previous timestamp markers from the transcript
3. **Dynamic Button States**: Buttons are enabled/disabled based on availability of next/previous markers
4. **Real-time Updates**: Navigation buttons update their state when time fields change
5. **Seamless Integration**: Navigation works with existing video update functionality

## Usage

1. When the clip player page loads, the transcript is displayed below the form
2. The navigation buttons show the current state (enabled/disabled) based on available timestamps
3. Click "Previous marker" (⏮) to jump to the previous timestamp
4. Click "Next marker" (⏭) to jump to the next timestamp
5. The video automatically updates when timestamps change
6. Navigation buttons update their state after each change

## Technical Details

- Timestamps are extracted using regex pattern matching
- Duplicate timestamps are removed and sorted
- Navigation logic efficiently finds adjacent timestamps
- Button states are updated on every time field change
- All styling maintains consistency with the existing dark theme
