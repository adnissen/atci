# Transcript Modification Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented automatic transcript modification functionality that is called during video processing to add model information to transcript files.

## What was implemented:

### 1. TranscriptModifier Module (`lib/autotranscript/transcript_modifier.ex`)
- **Purpose**: Modifies transcript files by removing the first line and adding model information
- **Key functions**:
  - `modify_transcript_file/1`: Main function that processes transcript files
  - `get_model_filename/0`: Extracts model filename from config manager
  - `modify_content/2`: Handles the actual content modification logic

### 2. Integration with Video Processing
Modified `lib/autotranscript/transcriber/video_processor.ex` to automatically call transcript modification in two key places:

#### Main Transcription Process (`transcribe_audio/1`)
- After Whisper creates the transcript file
- Automatically modifies the file before continuing

#### Partial Transcription Process (`transcribe_temp_mp3_partial/1`)
- After creating partial transcript files
- Ensures consistency across all transcript types

## How it works:

1. **Video Processing**: When a video is processed, Whisper generates a transcript file
2. **Automatic Modification**: The `TranscriptModifier.modify_transcript_file/1` function is called
3. **Model Info Extraction**: Gets the model path from ConfigManager (e.g., `/path/to/models/ggml-base.bin`)
4. **Content Modification**: 
   - Removes the first line of the transcript
   - Adds `model: ggml-base` as the new first line
5. **File Update**: Saves the modified content back to the transcript file

## Example:

**Before modification:**
```
This is a sample transcript generated by Whisper.
Hello, this is the actual transcript content.
This is the second line of the transcript.
```

**After modification:**
```
model: ggml-base
Hello, this is the actual transcript content.
This is the second line of the transcript.
```

## Benefits:
- **Automatic**: No manual intervention required
- **Consistent**: All transcript files get the same treatment
- **Informative**: Users can see which model was used for each transcript
- **Non-disruptive**: Integrates seamlessly with existing workflow

## Error Handling:
- If modification fails, a warning is logged but processing continues
- The original transcript file is preserved if there are any issues
- Graceful handling of empty files or missing model configuration

This implementation ensures that every transcript file created by the system automatically includes the model information at the beginning, making it easy to track which model was used for each transcription.
