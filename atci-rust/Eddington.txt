00:00:21.758 --> 00:00:22.759
Baby, I'm sorry.

00:00:25.261 --> 00:00:28.722
I didn't-- I was holding-- Like this.

00:00:28.723 --> 00:00:32.267
I was holding your hand. I was holding your hand.

00:00:32.268 --> 00:00:33.894
And I'm still--

00:00:33.895 --> 00:00:37.230
I'm looking and looking and looking. I'm looking.

00:00:37.231 --> 00:00:39.691
I'm looking for my perfect-- for my perfectly--

00:00:39.692 --> 00:00:41.444
My perf... ...ection.

00:00:41.944 --> 00:00:44.906
Yes. All of it. All of it!

00:00:45.948 --> 00:00:47.365
You don't believe me.

00:00:47.366 --> 00:00:49.451
'Cause I asked you to help. Yes!

00:00:49.452 --> 00:00:52.746
But you're in your box. Your little precious box.

00:00:52.747 --> 00:00:54.581
Your little box of... mud.

00:00:54.582 --> 00:00:57.627
You think it's yours. You think you did it.

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:02.881
What about I take the... lights out?

00:01:02.882 --> 00:01:07.219
The rights out, tights out, fiiiights out!

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.680
What now? Huh? Bitch. You think I'm locked out.

00:01:12.016 --> 00:01:16.604
I'm the one inside. And I'll spit you out.

00:01:17.146 --> 00:01:19.690
I am the first and the last.

00:01:20.316 --> 00:01:22.859
I will make you a million dollars in one day.

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.654
And all you got to do is give me your face and your eyes

00:01:25.655 --> 00:01:27.990
and your liiife-blood!

00:01:28.616 --> 00:01:30.283
The Devil's gonna get you rich in two minutes

00:01:30.284 --> 00:01:33.119
if you just-- Jaaackpot!

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.749
A flipped up, tipped up, tiiick-tock.

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.503
I've got my tripped up God-cock.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.089
More wicked boxes.

00:01:43.631 --> 00:01:45.507
And I know who set 'em here.

00:01:45.508 --> 00:01:47.300
I will show my will to all of you

00:01:47.301 --> 00:01:50.470
that smile with the pride of pigs.

00:01:50.471 --> 00:01:53.640
And all the pigs will listen when it's too late.

00:01:53.641 --> 00:01:57.769
The pigs and liars will burn forever when it's too late.

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.022
And all your boxes will be saaand.

00:02:01.023 --> 00:02:03.441
We're going to be talking about what happens

00:02:03.442 --> 00:02:05.277
if you are ready to have a baby,

00:02:05.278 --> 00:02:08.446
but your partner, your spouse, your significant other,

00:02:08.447 --> 00:02:10.532
is not ready to have a baby.

00:02:10.533 --> 00:02:13.326
That can be a really difficult place to be in.

00:02:13.327 --> 00:02:14.661
And it can actually be a lot

00:02:14.662 --> 00:02:16.413
of dealbreakers for relationships.

00:02:16.414 --> 00:02:17.998
Especially when one person

00:02:17.999 --> 00:02:19.916
really does want to start a family.

00:02:19.917 --> 00:02:21.209
And that's what they wanted

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:23.920
from day one of their life and they know that.

00:02:23.921 --> 00:02:26.006
And then maybe the other person just isn't ready yet

00:02:27.466 --> 00:02:29.218
...or really just doesn't want children or can't see them--

00:02:40.688 --> 00:02:41.647
What's this?

00:02:42.398 --> 00:02:43.357
Can I help you?

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:47.569
What's that mask for?

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:49.362
You didn't see the signs coming into our village

00:02:49.363 --> 00:02:51.239
of our rules and regulations, Sheriff?

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:52.866
This is Pueblo.

00:02:52.867 --> 00:02:54.034
No, it's not.

00:02:54.035 --> 00:02:56.202
I was just at a residence right back there.

00:02:56.203 --> 00:02:58.539
That is Sevilla County.

00:02:59.206 --> 00:03:01.041
That may be,

00:03:01.042 --> 00:03:03.919
but the border is there. This is Santa Lupe.

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:04.920
You don't ever come

00:03:04.921 --> 00:03:06.546
when we ask for your help, Sheriff.

00:03:06.547 --> 00:03:08.257
- You're trespassing. - Butterfly!

00:03:10.343 --> 00:03:11.718
People are dying of this thing, right?

00:03:13.095 --> 00:03:14.387
- People are dying. - Now, look.

00:03:14.388 --> 00:03:16.849
This one here, he's got it hanging off of his nose.

00:03:17.516 --> 00:03:20.977
I mean, what are we doing here? Listen. Just...

00:03:20.978 --> 00:03:23.230
I am listening. Shut up!

00:03:23.814 --> 00:03:26.275
When you're on our soil, put on your mask.

00:03:30.363 --> 00:03:33.366
Put on your mask, Sheriff.

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:46.711
Hey, you don't have to...

00:03:47.755 --> 00:03:50.048
0-1, to all monitoring units.

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:52.843
Got a call into the office advising about a disturbance.

00:04:04.814 --> 00:04:07.232
0-8, 0-4.

00:04:07.233 --> 00:04:11.152
Hi, Sheriff. It's another disorderly conduct with Lodge.

00:04:11.153 --> 00:04:13.155
But I was gonna see where Tooley's at.

00:04:15.616 --> 00:04:18.702
Uh, no, I'll take it.

00:04:18.703 --> 00:04:21.580
Ten-four. Uh, you sure? It's at the mayor's.

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:30.506
Sheriff?

00:04:31.757 --> 00:04:34.551
I heard you. Well, what does that mean?

00:04:34.552 --> 00:04:37.096
Is it his office, his house, the bar?

00:04:38.973 --> 00:04:42.143
Bar. But I was gonna check what Tooley's twenty was.

00:04:46.689 --> 00:04:47.732
No, I'll take it.

00:05:19.305 --> 00:05:20.680
Blonde bitches named Sarah

00:05:20.681 --> 00:05:22.307
think they're Rosa Parks.

00:05:22.308 --> 00:05:24.226
If I added her on Snap, what would I say?

00:05:24.727 --> 00:05:26.562
Uh, take a pic of you with me.

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:28.481
Prove that you're an ally.

00:05:28.856 --> 00:05:29.982
No, but really.

00:05:30.733 --> 00:05:31.983
I don't know. Send her a dick pic.

00:05:31.984 --> 00:05:33.652
See if she can guess what it is.

00:05:37.865 --> 00:05:39.532
- What do I do? - I don't know.

00:05:45.331 --> 00:05:47.874
Bro, no mask?

00:05:47.875 --> 00:05:49.877
No, I'm good. Bro.

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:54.714
What's that smell, by the way? A little reefer?

00:05:54.715 --> 00:05:56.091
I don't know. Your ass?

00:06:00.387 --> 00:06:01.888
And then, just the spillover.

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:04.057
Two, three hundred construction jobs, ongoing.

00:06:04.058 --> 00:06:06.059
The solar offset's a whole 'nother development.

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:07.435
Sure, sure. But, what?

00:06:07.436 --> 00:06:08.686
We just let these guys build this,

00:06:08.687 --> 00:06:10.271
whatever it is, data complex

00:06:10.272 --> 00:06:11.481
and then they up and close it down

00:06:11.482 --> 00:06:12.732
for whatever reason? We just got to eat that?

00:06:12.733 --> 00:06:14.567
Phil, there's clawbacks on everything.

00:06:14.568 --> 00:06:17.028
Gross receipt taxes, payback of property.

00:06:17.029 --> 00:06:18.905
There's no wishing tech away.

00:06:18.906 --> 00:06:22.117
Whether we jump on the boat now or get bulldozed,

00:06:22.118 --> 00:06:24.786
these guys, they're bringing an actual infrastructure

00:06:24.787 --> 00:06:26.246
for a real future.

00:06:26.247 --> 00:06:28.123
- A real future. - That's right.

00:06:28.124 --> 00:06:29.582
Can we count on your "yay" tomorrow?

00:06:32.044 --> 00:06:33.503
What is the problem?

00:06:37.758 --> 00:06:40.302
Well, he-- he's outside.

00:06:41.095 --> 00:06:43.012
I had to lock the door to keep him outside.

00:06:43.013 --> 00:06:44.973
It's been a whole hour like this.

00:06:44.974 --> 00:06:46.766
I can't understand you.

00:06:46.767 --> 00:06:47.643
Yes, you can.

00:06:52.148 --> 00:06:54.357
He's disturbing the peace. Again.

00:06:54.358 --> 00:06:55.901
He's blocking the entrance.

00:06:56.569 --> 00:06:59.571
Whose entrance? What are you even doing in there?

00:06:59.572 --> 00:07:01.114
It's takeaway drinks only.

00:07:01.115 --> 00:07:03.825
Those are town council members. That's essential business.

00:07:03.826 --> 00:07:04.951
Well, you can't just call

00:07:04.952 --> 00:07:06.411
essential business whatever you want.

00:07:06.412 --> 00:07:07.620
It's a city council meeting

00:07:07.621 --> 00:07:09.956
wherever city council people congregate.

00:07:09.957 --> 00:07:12.125
It's the Mayor's office if I'm inside.

00:07:12.126 --> 00:07:14.335
Okay, then you are open.

00:07:14.336 --> 00:07:16.087
And you have a paying customer...

00:07:16.088 --> 00:07:17.589
Customer?

00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:20.091
He's aggressive, he's dangerous, he needs to be locked up.

00:07:20.092 --> 00:07:21.467
Where would you have me send him?

00:07:21.468 --> 00:07:22.468
These are your streets...

00:07:22.469 --> 00:07:23.469
No, they're your streets, Sheriff.

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:24.512
...that you locked down.

00:07:24.513 --> 00:07:25.847
They're your streets to keep safe.

00:07:25.848 --> 00:07:27.307
And where is your mask?

00:07:27.308 --> 00:07:29.101
I don't--

00:07:29.685 --> 00:07:31.812
He doesn't have a mask on!

00:07:32.563 --> 00:07:34.564
- All right. - He's coughing!

00:07:34.565 --> 00:07:35.566
Okay.

00:07:36.192 --> 00:07:38.151
- No mask either with this guy? - All right.

00:07:38.152 --> 00:07:41.655
Hey.

00:08:14.521 --> 00:08:15.730
You get your little Instagram?

00:08:15.731 --> 00:08:17.733
Yeah, I got my little Instagram.

00:08:32.539 --> 00:08:34.249
Again, history repeats itself.

00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:37.252
And, uh, I mean, let's talk about 1956.

00:08:37.253 --> 00:08:39.754
Let's talk about the number 56 for just one minute.

00:08:39.755 --> 00:08:43.092
In California, you have Jesuit-educated Gavin Newsom.

00:08:43.425 --> 00:08:44.759
And he said to California,

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:47.845
as he became the first governor to lock down his state,

00:08:47.846 --> 00:08:51.391
he said, "56% of you will get Corona in eight weeks."

00:08:51.392 --> 00:08:53.601
Which is exactly 56 days.

00:08:53.602 --> 00:08:56.729
Of course, they keep looking at that lab in Wuhan, China.

00:08:56.730 --> 00:08:58.564
And if you look at that lab in Wuhan

00:08:58.565 --> 00:09:01.734
when it was established, it was 1956.

00:09:01.735 --> 00:09:04.070
Of course, that's the year Tom Hanks was born,

00:09:04.071 --> 00:09:05.488
the first celebrity with the virus.

00:09:05.489 --> 00:09:07.073
Mr. Sleepless In Seattle.

00:09:07.074 --> 00:09:09.284
By the way, Jenny Durkan was the mayor of Seattle

00:09:09.285 --> 00:09:12.996
when it became the first city in the world outside of China

00:09:12.997 --> 00:09:16.416
to have someone get the virus. And she was the 56th mayor.

00:09:16.417 --> 00:09:17.625
This is Gematria.

00:09:17.626 --> 00:09:19.335
Ancient practice of coding numbers into words.

00:09:19.336 --> 00:09:20.211
It's a simp--

00:09:25.759 --> 00:09:28.803
How many coincidences need to occur

00:09:28.804 --> 00:09:31.472
before we call this pattern a design?

00:09:31.473 --> 00:09:34.934
I-Is the end goal of media the end of mediation?

00:09:34.935 --> 00:09:36.477
We are here on this plane,

00:09:36.478 --> 00:09:38.313
somehow, as these things--

00:09:38.314 --> 00:09:39.731
- Hey. - Hey.

00:09:39.732 --> 00:09:41.274
How was your day?

00:09:41.275 --> 00:09:42.151
Good.

00:09:42.693 --> 00:09:43.860
How was yours?

00:09:43.861 --> 00:09:46.113
Good. I got those for you.

00:09:46.739 --> 00:09:47.990
Yeah, I'm all right.

00:09:51.118 --> 00:09:52.161
Something happen to you?

00:09:53.454 --> 00:09:54.454
What do you mean?

00:09:54.455 --> 00:09:55.414
Your limp.

00:09:56.498 --> 00:09:58.208
- Oh. - Hurt your leg?

00:09:58.667 --> 00:10:01.127
Just some...

00:10:01.128 --> 00:10:04.840
...stupid nonsense down at, um... the bar.

00:10:06.842 --> 00:10:08.092
Not-- Not with Ted.

00:10:08.093 --> 00:10:11.138
Just, you know, Lodge. You know, the homeless?

00:10:12.639 --> 00:10:13.848
It wasn't Ted.

00:10:17.895 --> 00:10:18.937
Whoa.

00:10:19.313 --> 00:10:20.773
What's this one about?

00:10:22.274 --> 00:10:24.818
Yeah, just an image I had. I don't know.

00:10:25.486 --> 00:10:28.155
Very weird. I like it.

00:10:30.574 --> 00:10:32.825
I sold two more of the new dolls.

00:10:32.826 --> 00:10:33.619
Really?

00:10:34.661 --> 00:10:35.537
Which ones?

00:10:36.455 --> 00:10:38.040
The spider legs

00:10:38.624 --> 00:10:42.044
and the girl sleeping on the tongue.

00:10:42.795 --> 00:10:45.589
Uh-huh. Well, that is great news, Louise.

00:10:53.639 --> 00:10:56.516
Wha-- She can't just email this, huh?

00:10:56.517 --> 00:10:57.892
Well, she does

00:10:57.893 --> 00:11:00.603
and then she checks my phone to see if I opened them.

00:11:00.604 --> 00:11:01.896
Yeah, well, that's why I told you

00:11:01.897 --> 00:11:03.565
you should put a passcode on.

00:11:04.525 --> 00:11:07.778
I did put a passcode on last week.

00:11:12.491 --> 00:11:17.078
Hey, you remember the deal when she moved in?

00:11:17.079 --> 00:11:18.956
That it was just 'til-- 'til April?

00:11:20.999 --> 00:11:22.793
You remember there's still a pandemic?

00:11:25.754 --> 00:11:27.172
I don't like it either.

00:11:28.090 --> 00:11:29.842
She took my work space.

00:11:32.386 --> 00:11:33.970
I mean, if she was an invalid,

00:11:33.971 --> 00:11:36.222
that'd be one thing, but...

00:11:36.223 --> 00:11:38.725
You know, even you said it feels like, uh,

00:11:39.101 --> 00:11:41.227
she's watching you all the time.

00:11:41.228 --> 00:11:44.272
No, I said it's like I'm being watched all the time.

00:11:44.273 --> 00:11:45.357
Not just by her.

00:11:48.235 --> 00:11:50.195
I-I know it feels that way,

00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:52.281
but it's not.

00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:55.117
I promise. Hey, look at me.

00:11:55.451 --> 00:11:57.453
I promise. Okay?

00:12:29.610 --> 00:12:30.610
I'm sorry.

00:12:30.611 --> 00:12:32.278
- No, no. - I'm sorry.

00:12:32.279 --> 00:12:34.322
- Oh, I'm sorry, darling. - No, no.

00:12:34.323 --> 00:12:37.910
Hey, you don't-- Don't apologize.

00:12:38.869 --> 00:12:40.204
- Okay? - Okay.

00:12:41.538 --> 00:12:43.080
I love you, baby.

00:12:49.630 --> 00:12:51.006
I am getting better.

00:12:52.799 --> 00:12:53.884
I know you are.

00:12:54.635 --> 00:12:55.511
I know.

00:13:07.064 --> 00:13:08.856
No truth can be verified.

00:13:08.857 --> 00:13:13.028
There is no truth on the level that you and me live at.

00:13:13.946 --> 00:13:16.030
Please, ask yourself why are we using Zoom now?

00:13:16.031 --> 00:13:17.032
What even is it?

00:13:18.033 --> 00:13:19.534
And it appears right at the same time

00:13:19.535 --> 00:13:21.537
as deepfake and lockdown.

00:13:23.830 --> 00:13:25.706
So why are you on the computer, then?

00:13:26.792 --> 00:13:28.794
- Iron's what kills people. - Morning.

00:13:30.462 --> 00:13:31.588
Hey, Dawn,

00:13:32.214 --> 00:13:34.173
the hot water got all used up again.

00:13:34.174 --> 00:13:36.343
Did you hear about this? Clade X?

00:13:37.094 --> 00:13:38.344
Mmm.

00:13:38.345 --> 00:13:41.514
In 2018. This is not a secret. Please look it up.

00:13:41.515 --> 00:13:44.183
They did a whole pandemic-modeling exercise

00:13:44.184 --> 00:13:46.018
at Johns Hopkins. Now...

00:13:46.019 --> 00:13:47.645
How do you simulate a pandemic

00:13:47.646 --> 00:13:49.772
two years before a pandemic even happens?

00:13:49.773 --> 00:13:52.066
Please ask yourselves that.

00:13:52.067 --> 00:13:53.026
How'd you sleep?

00:13:54.528 --> 00:13:56.195
I'm out of sleeping pills again.

00:13:56.196 --> 00:13:57.363
Thank you.

00:13:57.364 --> 00:13:59.907
- Okay. I'll pick some up later. - Okay.

00:13:59.908 --> 00:14:00.908
Why do I even talk?

00:14:00.909 --> 00:14:03.202
I'm just an old lady who's crazy.

00:14:03.203 --> 00:14:04.538
- Who's lost her mind. - Mom?

00:14:05.872 --> 00:14:07.082
What were you saying?

00:14:11.795 --> 00:14:13.088
I don't have to say it.

00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:15.757
You can read it. Here.

00:14:20.596 --> 00:14:21.471
Look at this.

00:14:22.431 --> 00:14:24.348
Pandemic Modeling Exercise.

00:14:24.349 --> 00:14:26.309
Event 201. This is from last year.

00:14:26.310 --> 00:14:28.185
Read it. Out loud.

00:14:28.186 --> 00:14:30.062
Please. Out loud.

00:14:30.063 --> 00:14:33.482
"Prepare the government, health officials and business people--"

00:14:33.483 --> 00:14:34.692
Business people. That's interesting.

00:14:34.693 --> 00:14:38.279
"For the breakout of an unprecedented coronavirus."

00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:41.158
Coronavirus. They used that word in 2019.

00:14:42.909 --> 00:14:44.785
You need to get your own laptop, Dawn.

00:14:44.786 --> 00:14:47.079
Your daddy was up against all these things.

00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:48.414
The corruption.

00:14:48.415 --> 00:14:49.875
It was just more buried.

00:14:51.752 --> 00:14:54.003
What, you don't think he was?

00:15:00.927 --> 00:15:02.679
You were at Ted Garcia's last night.

00:15:04.014 --> 00:15:06.141
It was his complaint, right?

00:15:06.558 --> 00:15:07.434
Right?

00:15:08.226 --> 00:15:10.145
He rings his little bell, and you come running.

00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:13.898
The fact that you can just stroll on over there,

00:15:13.899 --> 00:15:15.484
business as usual.

00:15:16.234 --> 00:15:17.401
What do you all even say to each other

00:15:17.402 --> 00:15:18.403
when you get there?

00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:20.197
"Hi. How are ya?"

00:15:20.739 --> 00:15:21.657
Mom.

00:15:21.990 --> 00:15:23.824
Where even is your anger, Joe?

00:15:23.825 --> 00:15:26.495
That's my question. Where's your anger, Lou?

00:15:27.204 --> 00:15:28.330
Hello?!

00:15:28.955 --> 00:15:31.582
This, this is how Ted Garcia gets away with everything.

00:15:31.583 --> 00:15:33.376
When I think about what your daddy would have done

00:15:33.377 --> 00:15:34.544
if he was still sheriff...

00:15:35.087 --> 00:15:36.128
There are more reported cases

00:15:36.129 --> 00:15:37.463
in New Mexico prisons

00:15:37.464 --> 00:15:39.507
than in all but four counties in the entire state.

00:15:39.508 --> 00:15:41.842
Only McKinley, San Juan, Bernalillo,

00:15:41.843 --> 00:15:43.344
and Doña Ana have more,

00:15:43.345 --> 00:15:46.555
yet these counts are dumped into the state totals every day!

00:15:46.556 --> 00:15:48.474
Why? They're in a prison!

00:15:48.475 --> 00:15:50.142
I would love to hear the rationale

00:15:50.143 --> 00:15:52.520
of why a restaurant in Hobbs has to go out of business

00:15:52.521 --> 00:15:53.813
to fight a disease in the Navajo nation.

00:15:53.814 --> 00:15:54.523
Whoa.

00:15:59.277 --> 00:16:00.945
Hey! Hey!

00:16:00.946 --> 00:16:03.156
What is going on here? Fred!

00:16:04.449 --> 00:16:06.283
He can't go in without a mask, Sheriff.

00:16:06.284 --> 00:16:07.326
Says who?

00:16:07.327 --> 00:16:08.786
You can't handle him like that.

00:16:08.787 --> 00:16:10.330
All right? Get your hands off him.

00:16:11.665 --> 00:16:13.499
- All right, let him in. - I can't breathe in a mask.

00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:16.712
It's a mandate, Sheriff. Isn't it? Since last week?

00:16:20.799 --> 00:16:22.884
There's a way to do it.

00:16:23.343 --> 00:16:25.011
There's a way to treat people.

00:16:26.596 --> 00:16:27.723
Just let him in.

00:16:32.853 --> 00:16:33.854
What?

00:16:34.521 --> 00:16:36.857
He can't breathe in his mask. You want him to starve too?

00:16:37.816 --> 00:16:38.984
I can't neither.

00:17:47.135 --> 00:17:48.427
No. No.

00:17:48.428 --> 00:17:49.304
Out!

00:17:50.138 --> 00:17:51.223
- Get out. - What is this?

00:17:51.765 --> 00:17:52.848
I have groceries.

00:17:52.849 --> 00:17:54.392
- I haven't checked out yet. - Out!

00:17:55.018 --> 00:17:56.602
Come on, Fred.

00:17:56.603 --> 00:17:58.062
- Wait a minute. - I'm sorry.

00:17:58.063 --> 00:17:59.563
You're welcome back any time wearing a mask.

00:17:59.564 --> 00:18:01.941
Why are you doing this? I can't breathe in it.

00:18:01.942 --> 00:18:03.108
That's much worse

00:18:03.109 --> 00:18:04.610
when you have to wait in line for a ventilator.

00:18:04.611 --> 00:18:05.945
I can't breathe in the mask.

00:18:05.946 --> 00:18:07.113
Get out!

00:18:18.250 --> 00:18:19.834
- Excuse me, Sheriff. - Yeah.

00:18:19.835 --> 00:18:22.837
I'm sorry, but you need a mask if you're going to be in here.

00:18:22.838 --> 00:18:25.339
It's okay.

00:18:25.340 --> 00:18:27.132
I-I don't.

00:18:27.133 --> 00:18:28.509
But--

00:18:28.510 --> 00:18:30.594
I'm sorry, but you're just not going to treat people like that.

00:18:30.595 --> 00:18:33.806
- Joe, what-- - I can't.

00:18:33.807 --> 00:18:35.391
Sheriff, I--

00:18:35.392 --> 00:18:37.142
- There's a mandate. I have to-- - Hey, Joe.

00:18:37.143 --> 00:18:38.227
It doesn't-- doesn't matter.

00:18:38.228 --> 00:18:39.771
Hey.

00:18:40.272 --> 00:18:41.064
Good morning.

00:18:41.606 --> 00:18:42.566
Hey, Tony.

00:18:43.525 --> 00:18:44.359
How we doing?

00:18:44.985 --> 00:18:46.735
Okay, Mayor. I think.

00:18:46.736 --> 00:18:48.572
We're-- We're fine.

00:18:49.281 --> 00:18:50.866
Well, that's good. That's good. That's good.

00:18:52.242 --> 00:18:53.159
Listen,

00:18:53.827 --> 00:18:54.578
Joe,

00:18:55.495 --> 00:18:56.246
you know,

00:18:59.332 --> 00:19:01.333
if a healthy person with a mask...

00:19:01.334 --> 00:19:03.544
Oh, here we go. Mm-hmm.

00:19:03.545 --> 00:19:06.338
...gets exposed to a Covid-19 person...

00:19:06.339 --> 00:19:07.673
- Uh-huh. - ...without a mask...

00:19:07.674 --> 00:19:08.841
Yeah. Yeah.

00:19:08.842 --> 00:19:11.011
...then they got a 70% chance of catching it.

00:19:12.304 --> 00:19:13.554
But if we all wear them,

00:19:13.555 --> 00:19:15.639
then we can reduce the transmission to 1.5%.

00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:17.683
You don't even know what you're talking about.

00:19:17.684 --> 00:19:20.853
1.4% of nothing is what?

00:19:20.854 --> 00:19:23.398
And actually, Joe, this is simple because

00:19:23.857 --> 00:19:25.650
there is a state mandate.

00:19:26.318 --> 00:19:28.944
No, that's-- It's not enforceable.

00:19:28.945 --> 00:19:30.238
It is enforceable.

00:19:30.864 --> 00:19:32.949
It absolutely is enforceable.

00:19:33.575 --> 00:19:35.743
Made so by the Governor and the Department of Health.

00:19:35.744 --> 00:19:37.287
You just gonna keep filming?

00:19:37.787 --> 00:19:40.456
Is that-- You getting it? Uh-huh.

00:19:40.457 --> 00:19:42.750
What the Mayor's talking about-- Hello, sir.

00:19:42.751 --> 00:19:45.461
The Mayor's talking about policy. Okay?

00:19:45.462 --> 00:19:48.714
If you don't want me in here without a mask,

00:19:48.715 --> 00:19:50.716
you must change the law.

00:19:50.717 --> 00:19:53.261
County commissioners are right here in Eddington.

00:19:53.595 --> 00:19:55.054
Put it on the agenda.

00:19:55.055 --> 00:19:56.764
Get a county ordinance

00:19:56.765 --> 00:19:59.850
prohibiting me, and Fred, and the rest of us

00:19:59.851 --> 00:20:02.937
that want to live our lives without a mask--

00:20:02.938 --> 00:20:05.315
Would you-- Would you put that-- Excuse me.

00:20:05.732 --> 00:20:08.276
Excuse me! Is that Fred's?

00:20:08.777 --> 00:20:09.861
Put it down.

00:20:10.570 --> 00:20:11.362
Joe.

00:20:17.118 --> 00:20:19.996
I-I-I just--

00:20:20.789 --> 00:20:21.623
Okay.

00:20:22.958 --> 00:20:23.750
Okay.

00:20:25.752 --> 00:20:27.252
Go on. Go.

00:20:27.253 --> 00:20:28.754
What? What?

00:20:28.755 --> 00:20:29.756
Everything's fine.

00:20:30.173 --> 00:20:30.840
Okay?

00:20:35.303 --> 00:20:36.596
You know who this is for?

00:20:43.812 --> 00:20:45.187
Fred, come on,

00:20:45.188 --> 00:20:46.690
before you get hit by a car.

00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:48.941
- All right, now listen to me. - Yes, sir.

00:20:48.942 --> 00:20:50.401
I want you to take this.

00:20:50.402 --> 00:20:51.610
What is this? What is this?

00:20:51.611 --> 00:20:53.445
It's for you. You have yourself a good day. Okay?

00:20:53.446 --> 00:20:54.947
Wait, wait. Can I pay you back for this?

00:20:54.948 --> 00:20:56.156
No, no, no.

00:20:56.157 --> 00:20:58.159
Uh, Sheriff, Sheriff. Wait, wait, wait. Please.

00:20:58.910 --> 00:21:01.037
A picture. A picture?

00:21:01.663 --> 00:21:02.455
Okay.

00:21:05.333 --> 00:21:08.627
- Ready? - Hold on. Hold on.

00:21:08.628 --> 00:21:09.421
Smile.

00:21:35.780 --> 00:21:37.656
Ladies and gentlemen, what have you,

00:21:37.657 --> 00:21:40.868
this is Joe Cross, sheriff of Sevilla County.

00:21:40.869 --> 00:21:44.830
And, first off, allow me to say that I'm asthmatic.

00:21:44.831 --> 00:21:46.290
I know. Who cares?

00:21:46.291 --> 00:21:50.794
But I do find it very difficult to breathe in these masks. Okay?

00:21:50.795 --> 00:21:54.965
Now, second off, there is no Covid in Eddington.

00:21:54.966 --> 00:21:58.469
There's no Covid in Sevilla County,

00:21:58.470 --> 00:22:02.515
yet a state mandate pushed by our mayor and his governor

00:22:02.891 --> 00:22:05.434
says that I cannot shop for food

00:22:05.435 --> 00:22:07.561
without risking an asthma attack.

00:22:07.562 --> 00:22:11.774
And you cannot exercise your freedom of choice

00:22:11.775 --> 00:22:16.529
without being, you know, uh, publicly shamed.

00:22:17.197 --> 00:22:18.697
Bec--

00:22:18.698 --> 00:22:22.535
Because what I just saw just... ...a moment ago...

00:22:23.369 --> 00:22:26.246
Uh...

00:22:26.247 --> 00:22:27.332
I mean, I just--

00:22:28.333 --> 00:22:29.793
How-- How did we get here?

00:22:30.585 --> 00:22:33.963
Okay? And even worse, is it worth it?

00:22:34.672 --> 00:22:38.968
Is it worth it to combat a virus that isn't even here

00:22:39.677 --> 00:22:41.971
at the cost of being at war with your neighbors

00:22:42.347 --> 00:22:44.099
and your-- your family?

00:22:45.892 --> 00:22:48.394
Because that-- that's what community is, isn't it?

00:22:48.728 --> 00:22:50.605
It's a family. Okay?

00:22:51.064 --> 00:22:54.108
Because you can ruin a man's day

00:22:54.109 --> 00:22:57.194
or you can do the right thing and you can be kind,

00:22:57.195 --> 00:22:59.030
and you can free his heart.

00:23:01.699 --> 00:23:05.078
We need to free each other's hearts.

00:23:09.332 --> 00:23:11.334
And that's why I'm running for mayor.

00:23:12.752 --> 00:23:14.337
Mayor of Eddington.

00:23:14.921 --> 00:23:16.213
Did he just say what I think he said?

00:23:16.214 --> 00:23:20.384
I have, uh, served this county as sheriff for seven years

00:23:20.385 --> 00:23:22.803
and it has been my honor, and I would be honored

00:23:22.804 --> 00:23:24.222
to serve you as mayor.

00:23:28.309 --> 00:23:29.060
Hey!

00:23:33.731 --> 00:23:35.941
- Yeah, right. - You're going to be okay.

00:23:38.403 --> 00:23:40.113
Okay, here comes another one.

00:23:40.947 --> 00:23:42.823
Three cops for one guy.

00:23:42.824 --> 00:23:44.283
Here we go.

00:23:44.284 --> 00:23:46.661
Sheriff, this for real?

00:23:48.037 --> 00:23:50.831
Yes. All right, we got to make up for lost time. Who's this?

00:23:50.832 --> 00:23:52.876
A day drinker. OWI.

00:23:54.377 --> 00:23:56.879
I'm not gonna tell you any more because one:

00:23:56.880 --> 00:23:58.255
I don't have to,

00:23:58.256 --> 00:23:59.464
and two: you're gonna do whatever shit you're gonna do.

00:23:59.465 --> 00:24:01.300
Wow. How much did you drink, kid?

00:24:01.301 --> 00:24:02.926
Um, honestly, low-key,

00:24:02.927 --> 00:24:04.344
not enough for you to put me in here.

00:24:04.345 --> 00:24:06.305
He refused to take the field test.

00:24:06.306 --> 00:24:08.849
Okay, campaign signs. Now which one of you has Photoshop?

00:24:08.850 --> 00:24:11.310
Oh, uh, my uncle does, but I think it expired.

00:24:11.311 --> 00:24:13.312
Okay, un-expire it. Get on down to Kinko's in Las Cruces.

00:24:13.313 --> 00:24:14.521
"Joe Cross for Mayor." Okay?

00:24:14.522 --> 00:24:15.856
Guy, you can draw, right?

00:24:15.857 --> 00:24:17.149
Just stick figures.

00:24:17.150 --> 00:24:18.859
Okay, good. Look, here's what I want. A man.

00:24:18.860 --> 00:24:19.860
I hope you're locked and loaded...

00:24:19.861 --> 00:24:20.861
He's got a face mask...

00:24:20.862 --> 00:24:22.029
...because you got to get me.

00:24:22.030 --> 00:24:24.323
...but he's got x's for eyes 'cause he's dead.

00:24:24.324 --> 00:24:25.949
Look, I know I made a mistake, okay?

00:24:25.950 --> 00:24:27.451
I know what you guys are trying to do.

00:24:27.452 --> 00:24:28.911
I know what kind of cops you are.

00:24:28.912 --> 00:24:31.038
Look, I don't know what else to say.

00:24:31.039 --> 00:24:33.081
Now I need your boys' support.

00:24:33.082 --> 00:24:34.541
Okay, this is what we're doing now.

00:24:34.542 --> 00:24:36.919
You've been deputized. This is our campaign office.

00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:39.214
So, yes, right? Yes!

00:24:40.965 --> 00:24:41.799
Hell yeah.

00:24:42.175 --> 00:24:42.967
Yes!

00:24:43.635 --> 00:24:46.178
- Yeah. - Okay, good. Okay.

00:24:47.513 --> 00:24:49.181
Guy, look, do me a favor.

00:24:49.182 --> 00:24:50.182
Get one of your friends to buy

00:24:50.183 --> 00:24:51.516
one of Louise's dolls again. Okay?

00:24:51.517 --> 00:24:52.517
Oh, yeah. Yes, sir.

00:24:52.518 --> 00:24:53.727
I'll pay 'em straight back.

00:24:53.728 --> 00:24:56.063
Can do. Does it matter which one?

00:24:56.064 --> 00:24:57.981
Just one of the new ones. Doesn't matter.

00:24:59.567 --> 00:25:01.527
Hey, hey, Sheriff, check this out.

00:25:02.820 --> 00:25:05.030
What's that? Three hundred yards?

00:25:05.031 --> 00:25:06.698
Three-fifty. No scope.

00:25:06.699 --> 00:25:07.699
Promise?

00:25:07.700 --> 00:25:10.202
Yeah. I still got the AR out for practice.

00:25:10.203 --> 00:25:11.536
That's beautiful, Mikey.

00:25:11.537 --> 00:25:13.747
But you ain't shit 'til you beat mine.

00:25:15.750 --> 00:25:17.000
Sheriff's Department.

00:25:17.001 --> 00:25:20.128
Hey, Sheriff, if you win, what does that mean for here?

00:25:20.129 --> 00:25:22.589
Well, we get a bigger budget, I'll tell you that much.

00:25:22.590 --> 00:25:23.424
Sheriff, it's for you.

00:25:23.841 --> 00:25:24.968
Okay.

00:25:25.885 --> 00:25:27.761
Hey, Guy, let's get going on signatures. All right?

00:25:27.762 --> 00:25:29.305
Get ourselves on the ballot.

00:25:30.265 --> 00:25:31.348
Hello.

00:25:31.349 --> 00:25:32.976
Joe, I'm outside your office.

00:25:40.525 --> 00:25:43.735
I am recording this. Fair warning.

00:25:43.736 --> 00:25:45.071
That really necessary?

00:25:45.613 --> 00:25:46.948
You are a public servant.

00:25:48.074 --> 00:25:49.117
So are you.

00:25:49.617 --> 00:25:50.575
Yep.

00:25:50.576 --> 00:25:52.035
And I think it's, uh,

00:25:52.036 --> 00:25:54.830
better if we just let it all out on the table. Okay?

00:25:54.831 --> 00:25:58.167
I got nothing to hide, you got nothing to hide.

00:26:01.963 --> 00:26:03.088
Okay.

00:26:03.089 --> 00:26:03.881
Well...

00:26:05.425 --> 00:26:06.342
First I'd--

00:26:08.261 --> 00:26:10.346
I just want to apologize if I offended you

00:26:10.930 --> 00:26:12.180
for this morning or for last night--

00:26:12.181 --> 00:26:14.517
No. No apology needed. You didn't.

00:26:15.935 --> 00:26:16.811
Okay.

00:26:17.645 --> 00:26:18.813
Because if I did...

00:26:21.316 --> 00:26:23.067
then that would help me understand.

00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:26.737
Well, your term is up, and, uh...

00:26:26.738 --> 00:26:28.405
your town is dead.

00:26:28.406 --> 00:26:30.533
Now, how can I help you understand?

00:26:35.663 --> 00:26:37.497
Look, Joe--

00:26:37.498 --> 00:26:38.541
Six feet.

00:26:43.379 --> 00:26:44.922
We never talked about it.

00:26:45.798 --> 00:26:47.550
The whole, you know...

00:26:48.801 --> 00:26:49.677
The whole--

00:26:50.970 --> 00:26:53.680
Can we just talk? Can we just-- Just the two of us?

00:26:53.681 --> 00:26:56.517
Yeah. We are, we are.

00:26:58.061 --> 00:26:58.936
Okay.

00:27:00.355 --> 00:27:01.980
So maybe I just talk to your video.

00:27:01.981 --> 00:27:04.232
Ask where all your deputies went?

00:27:04.233 --> 00:27:06.526
Okay, well, why don't you just ask your governor

00:27:06.527 --> 00:27:08.695
about her little Catch and Release policy. Okay?

00:27:08.696 --> 00:27:09.780
Because if it wasn't for that,

00:27:09.781 --> 00:27:12.032
maybe I could hold on to my deputies

00:27:12.033 --> 00:27:13.658
and the people we arrest.

00:27:13.659 --> 00:27:16.370
I know-- I know one of them was fired for excessive force

00:27:16.371 --> 00:27:17.829
and another one was forced to quit

00:27:17.830 --> 00:27:19.790
by a YouTube first amendment auditor.

00:27:19.791 --> 00:27:20.832
Yeah. Okay. Yes,

00:27:20.833 --> 00:27:22.167
that is the same auditor

00:27:22.168 --> 00:27:23.418
that drove away your worthless police department.

00:27:23.419 --> 00:27:25.462
Your Undersheriff died from a fentanyl overdose.

00:27:25.463 --> 00:27:26.797
From handling fentanyl. Okay?

00:27:26.798 --> 00:27:28.256
And your Captain and your Chief Deputy...

00:27:28.257 --> 00:27:29.549
He confiscated it without gloves.

00:27:29.550 --> 00:27:32.469
- ...took jobs in Rio Rancho. - That was devastating!

00:27:32.470 --> 00:27:34.137
You can't keep your own office going,

00:27:34.138 --> 00:27:35.555
but you're gonna run mine?

00:27:35.556 --> 00:27:38.017
Leave your mess here and start a whole new one.

00:27:42.146 --> 00:27:43.688
And I do think it's because of the person

00:27:43.689 --> 00:27:46.483
that's name you might not want me saying on camera.

00:27:46.484 --> 00:27:48.026
Oh, s-say her name.

00:27:48.027 --> 00:27:49.820
Okay? Because I think you're the one that doesn't want it.

00:27:49.821 --> 00:27:50.904
I do think it's because of that.

00:27:50.905 --> 00:27:52.114
Is that what you think?

00:27:52.115 --> 00:27:53.991
Well, I'll tell you what I think, Ted. Okay?

00:27:54.700 --> 00:27:57.829
I used to think that you were some big deal,

00:27:58.579 --> 00:28:02.249
but now I realize, and I can tell you flat-out to your face

00:28:02.250 --> 00:28:05.752
that I am a much better human being than you.

00:28:05.753 --> 00:28:07.712
And I'm gonna make a better, and stronger,

00:28:07.713 --> 00:28:09.756
and more honest leader than you.

00:28:09.757 --> 00:28:12.385
So let's just let the voters decide.

00:28:15.096 --> 00:28:17.473
You're making a mistake.

00:28:17.932 --> 00:28:19.891
Is that why you ran here all panicked?

00:28:19.892 --> 00:28:21.685
I came to save you from embarrassment.

00:28:21.686 --> 00:28:23.603
Oh, gee-whiz, I'm tearing up.

00:28:23.604 --> 00:28:25.939
Forfeiting 30 years of property taxes,

00:28:25.940 --> 00:28:28.275
and you won't say because of some NDA you signed,

00:28:28.276 --> 00:28:29.776
but you want a "yay" from everyone here.

00:28:29.777 --> 00:28:31.945
He explained this already, Paula.

00:28:31.946 --> 00:28:33.238
- Yeah. Yeah. - Explained what?

00:28:33.239 --> 00:28:35.615
Why doesn't he explain about the water and energy

00:28:35.616 --> 00:28:36.741
these data centers consume

00:28:36.742 --> 00:28:38.702
when we're in a historic drought?

00:28:38.703 --> 00:28:40.078
- We're always in a drought. - Yes, exactly.

00:28:40.079 --> 00:28:41.746
And we're making up for the energy

00:28:41.747 --> 00:28:43.915
and water with the solar that we're bringing in.

00:28:43.916 --> 00:28:46.668
Okay, so-- so let's talk about the solar.

00:28:46.669 --> 00:28:49.254
No. Uh, I'm sorry. You know what?

00:28:49.255 --> 00:28:50.797
Can we call the question, Phil? We've got to just call it.

00:28:50.798 --> 00:28:51.965
Excuse me?

00:28:51.966 --> 00:28:54.968
Okay. All right. Uh, item 50.

00:28:54.969 --> 00:28:58.889
Third reading of a resolution approving...

00:28:58.890 --> 00:29:00.140
What?

00:29:00.141 --> 00:29:01.558
...a series of six industrial revenue bonds

00:29:01.559 --> 00:29:05.896
for the construction of a, uh, proposed hyperscale data campus

00:29:05.897 --> 00:29:07.314
in Eddington, New Mexico.

00:29:07.315 --> 00:29:09.941
Excuse me? A question needs to be seconded,

00:29:09.942 --> 00:29:10.984
and I am the agreed-upon Chairwoman.

00:29:10.985 --> 00:29:12.110
Point of order!

00:29:12.111 --> 00:29:13.404
Can we not fucking shut this bitch up?

00:29:13.779 --> 00:29:15.113
Just chill.

00:29:15.114 --> 00:29:16.866
Question has been called. I've got my second.

00:29:20.661 --> 00:29:21.537
Mask over nose.

00:29:22.622 --> 00:29:23.748
Like you're writing.

00:29:26.959 --> 00:29:28.293
Hey, you know,

00:29:28.294 --> 00:29:29.628
you might actually read that while you're reading

00:29:29.629 --> 00:29:31.464
because you're forgetting half of it.

00:29:34.592 --> 00:29:35.717
Ted, hey,

00:29:35.718 --> 00:29:37.344
this is what you need to focus on,

00:29:37.345 --> 00:29:39.179
not your dumbass Sheriff.

00:29:39.180 --> 00:29:41.014
Just the shit with his wife's mental health,

00:29:41.015 --> 00:29:42.140
- we shut him right down. - I've said it already.

00:29:42.141 --> 00:29:43.725
I don't want to go there. I meant that.

00:29:44.685 --> 00:29:45.727
- So you fucked her... - No!

00:29:45.728 --> 00:29:47.354
- It's a small town. - No!

00:29:47.355 --> 00:29:48.731
No, I did not.

00:29:49.315 --> 00:29:52.150
I went out with her a couple of times 20 years ago.

00:29:52.151 --> 00:29:54.277
She was weird. She wouldn't let me touch her.

00:29:54.278 --> 00:29:55.655
I didn't want to touch her.

00:29:55.988 --> 00:29:57.447
So I dropped it.

00:29:57.448 --> 00:29:58.865
And then out of nowhere, her whackadoo ma

00:29:58.866 --> 00:30:00.700
came after me, like, six months later

00:30:00.701 --> 00:30:03.161
when she got apparently pregnant.

00:30:03.162 --> 00:30:06.332
That was six months after I never touched her.

00:30:08.209 --> 00:30:09.627
You see how that sounds, though?

00:30:10.169 --> 00:30:12.797
And her mom, who is crazy, is very online.

00:30:14.340 --> 00:30:16.133
Oh, before I forget...

00:30:18.427 --> 00:30:19.929
The Governor says thank you.

00:30:25.226 --> 00:30:26.310
Well, that's nice.

00:30:27.103 --> 00:30:28.562
Would have been nicer in person.

00:30:28.563 --> 00:30:29.521
Yeah, well, you get that through,

00:30:29.522 --> 00:30:30.814
you can tell her yourself.

00:30:30.815 --> 00:30:32.608
Be in her office when she goes to Washington.

00:30:33.693 --> 00:30:34.443
Hey!

00:30:36.028 --> 00:30:37.613
Whose car do you think that is?

00:30:38.072 --> 00:30:40.615
- You said I could. - I said what?

00:30:40.616 --> 00:30:43.035
You said I could borrow the car to hang with Brian.

00:30:51.210 --> 00:30:52.711
What do you think you're doing?

00:30:52.712 --> 00:30:54.546
You said I could borrow the car.

00:30:54.547 --> 00:30:55.880
What's this I'm hearing

00:30:55.881 --> 00:30:58.592
about a gathering last week, and you were there?

00:30:58.593 --> 00:31:00.927
If you mean Saturday, that was, like, five people.

00:31:00.928 --> 00:31:03.139
We were double-distanced and we all wore masks.

00:31:06.976 --> 00:31:08.394
That's not six feet.

00:31:09.020 --> 00:31:09.895
Excuse me?

00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:13.024
Just who do you think you're talking with?

00:31:15.693 --> 00:31:17.694
- Sorry. - We are in lockdown.

00:31:17.695 --> 00:31:19.572
I'm the one forcing lockdown.

00:31:20.281 --> 00:31:21.573
Anyone sees you out at a gathering late at night.

00:31:21.574 --> 00:31:23.074
It's not late and it's only five people.

00:31:23.075 --> 00:31:24.784
My son undermining my policies.

00:31:24.785 --> 00:31:27.162
You catch this, and you could die. Okay?

00:31:27.163 --> 00:31:28.496
- Do you know how death works? - Yeah. I'm just trying

00:31:28.497 --> 00:31:29.956
- to see my friend... - No more Brian.

00:31:29.957 --> 00:31:31.751
so I don't have to kill myself.

00:31:33.878 --> 00:31:35.879
Just go. Out of my face.

00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:38.007
Only Brian. Only!

00:31:40.468 --> 00:31:42.094
It's Mom's birthday, by the way.

00:31:43.095 --> 00:31:44.387
Good for her.

00:31:44.388 --> 00:31:45.597
What am I supposed to do with that, Eric?

00:31:45.598 --> 00:31:47.265
You want to send her a letter? I'm just saying.

00:31:47.266 --> 00:31:48.725
- She ain't dropped us any pins. - Okay. Whatever.

00:31:48.726 --> 00:31:50.143
- Who cares? - And wash your hands.

00:31:50.144 --> 00:31:52.896
Covid stays alive on paper for five weeks.

00:31:54.690 --> 00:31:56.816
When my son and me woke up one morning

00:31:56.817 --> 00:32:00.654
to find that my wife, his mother, had abandoned us

00:32:00.655 --> 00:32:03.281
without a note, without a word,

00:32:03.282 --> 00:32:05.117
we were devastated.

00:32:05.576 --> 00:32:07.661
All hope seemed lost.

00:32:07.662 --> 00:32:11.122
But we had our community to lift us up.

00:32:11.123 --> 00:32:12.541
We had Eddington.

00:32:14.251 --> 00:32:15.794
And when I first ran for Mayor,

00:32:15.795 --> 00:32:17.504
it's 'cause I wanted to give back to the town

00:32:17.505 --> 00:32:19.298
that has given me so much.

00:32:20.383 --> 00:32:22.300
Since then, we've helped the Governor

00:32:22.301 --> 00:32:23.593
in her mission to start building

00:32:23.594 --> 00:32:27.013
a 100% clean energy economy.

00:32:27.014 --> 00:32:30.141
We're working to provide homes to new technologies

00:32:30.142 --> 00:32:33.938
and create new, reliable, secure jobs.

00:32:34.438 --> 00:32:36.649
And as we walk towards the next term,

00:32:37.024 --> 00:32:39.693
I'm ready to continue leading our town

00:32:39.694 --> 00:32:41.361
and fighting the pandemic

00:32:41.362 --> 00:32:43.655
and the racial and economic inequities

00:32:43.656 --> 00:32:45.448
that Covid-19 only made worse.

00:32:45.449 --> 00:32:49.327
Racial inequities? What the fuck is he doing to fight that?

00:32:49.328 --> 00:32:51.247
Well, he's Hispanic.

00:32:54.959 --> 00:32:56.126
Okay, but who are--

00:32:56.127 --> 00:32:57.210
Where is he getting these Black ladies from?

00:32:57.211 --> 00:32:58.921
What, is he shipping in people now?

00:33:00.840 --> 00:33:02.841
What is this? The Jeffersons?

00:33:02.842 --> 00:33:05.385
Re-elect Ted Garcia for mayor.

00:33:05.386 --> 00:33:08.555
We can't go back. We can only go better.

00:33:08.556 --> 00:33:09.889
Race you to come up with a better slogan.

00:33:09.890 --> 00:33:11.057
And you too.

00:33:11.058 --> 00:33:12.601
I already put eight of them on the board.

00:33:14.353 --> 00:33:16.896
- Oh. - Uh, well...

00:33:16.897 --> 00:33:18.565
How about-- Wait, so...

00:33:18.566 --> 00:33:21.234
theirs goes, "We can't go back, we can only go better."

00:33:21.235 --> 00:33:23.862
So we go, "Yeah, we can't go back,

00:33:23.863 --> 00:33:26.573
but we can, like, you know.

00:33:26.574 --> 00:33:28.908
We can learn by our mistakes."

00:33:28.909 --> 00:33:29.701
Yeah.

00:33:29.702 --> 00:33:31.035
And Bitcoin.

00:33:31.036 --> 00:33:33.246
Use it to get county residents on the blockchain, too.

00:33:33.247 --> 00:33:34.247
You know, get 'em motivated.

00:33:34.248 --> 00:33:35.915
- Hey, before I forget. - Hey, Sheriff.

00:33:35.916 --> 00:33:37.333
- I got in with the city clerk... - Back up.

00:33:37.334 --> 00:33:39.461
...and we need a chairperson and a treasurer.

00:33:39.462 --> 00:33:40.462
Hey, Sheriff, look at this.

00:33:40.463 --> 00:33:42.088
I got 43 names on the petition...

00:33:42.089 --> 00:33:43.840
- Hey, finish this up for me. - ...but we're gonna need 150.

00:33:43.841 --> 00:33:45.049
I ran through the council meetings

00:33:45.050 --> 00:33:46.469
that are all on YouTube.

00:33:47.094 --> 00:33:48.554
You're gonna want to see this.

00:33:49.305 --> 00:33:50.889
The man that's forcing this item through

00:33:50.890 --> 00:33:52.265
is a man that turned off

00:33:52.266 --> 00:33:53.600
his people's lights

00:33:53.601 --> 00:33:55.351
in the middle of a global health pandemic.

00:33:55.352 --> 00:33:57.645
What about their businesses that you shuttered?

00:33:57.646 --> 00:33:59.731
You already got the state to make that nice road

00:33:59.732 --> 00:34:01.608
that you say is for tourism,

00:34:01.609 --> 00:34:03.735
but all I see is it leads straight to the site

00:34:03.736 --> 00:34:05.111
of this hypothetical data campus.

00:34:05.112 --> 00:34:06.780
Pardon me. Is Paula in?

00:34:06.781 --> 00:34:08.615
So what is Solidgoldmagikarp?

00:34:08.616 --> 00:34:10.742
Is it like, what, Microsoft or--

00:34:10.743 --> 00:34:12.702
Oh, not even. It's some random AI

00:34:12.703 --> 00:34:15.663
or Deep Learning or some crap.

00:34:15.664 --> 00:34:18.291
Warren's the one that got Ted to run in the first place.

00:34:18.292 --> 00:34:20.210
Land commissioner is his, too.

00:34:26.759 --> 00:34:27.718
Okay, I'm gonna go.

00:34:28.552 --> 00:34:29.595
What would I say?

00:34:30.137 --> 00:34:32.765
I-I wouldn't say anything 'cause she's annoying as fuck.

00:34:33.682 --> 00:34:35.934
She's worse than my dad with her social justice shit.

00:34:35.935 --> 00:34:37.769
- Where are you going? - Getting another beer.

00:34:37.770 --> 00:34:39.438
Dude, you have to drive us back.

00:34:57.748 --> 00:34:58.790
Oh, shit, I love that book.

00:34:59.625 --> 00:35:00.875
Sorry, what?

00:35:00.876 --> 00:35:01.585
I love that book.

00:35:03.003 --> 00:35:04.504
You know she was awarded

00:35:04.505 --> 00:35:07.466
the Lenin Peace Prize by the Soviet Union?

00:35:08.467 --> 00:35:09.552
Oh, really?

00:35:11.095 --> 00:35:12.137
I'm Brian.

00:35:12.763 --> 00:35:13.680
Hi.

00:35:13.681 --> 00:35:14.848
I know you're Sarah.

00:35:14.849 --> 00:35:15.891
You were, like, a year above me, I think.

00:35:16.475 --> 00:35:17.393
Okay.

00:35:19.186 --> 00:35:22.773
It's weird to be gathering, right? Like...

00:35:24.191 --> 00:35:26.317
Feels like this will be in the news in a few days.

00:35:26.318 --> 00:35:27.444
Superspreader.

00:35:29.905 --> 00:35:30.739
Sorry.

00:35:33.284 --> 00:35:35.034
You guys want a beer?

00:35:35.035 --> 00:35:35.952
- Sure. - Sure.

00:35:48.757 --> 00:35:51.718
No. No, you're fine. She's just doing her own thing.

00:35:51.719 --> 00:35:54.012
Oh. Okay. Cool.

00:35:54.013 --> 00:35:57.390
So, wait, what did he say when he came up to you?

00:35:58.642 --> 00:35:59.559
He said something about my book...

00:35:59.560 --> 00:36:00.518
Who's your friend?

00:36:03.689 --> 00:36:04.565
I don't know.

00:36:06.358 --> 00:36:08.944
She's just trying to make her old-ass boyfriend jealous.

00:36:09.987 --> 00:36:12.196
She has a boyfriend? Where is he?

00:36:12.197 --> 00:36:13.532
Not here.

00:36:16.035 --> 00:36:17.368
Oh, there he is.

00:36:17.369 --> 00:36:19.203
They're not dating anymore.

00:36:19.204 --> 00:36:21.205
She dumped him because he's a cop.

00:36:21.206 --> 00:36:23.499
Or then he broke up with her. Whatever.

00:36:23.500 --> 00:36:25.168
So many privileged white kids

00:36:25.169 --> 00:36:27.962
suddenly crying about "anti-racism", it's just like--

00:36:27.963 --> 00:36:29.797
Yeah, no. I get it. It's true.

00:36:29.798 --> 00:36:32.425
I mean, really, it's just another display of privilege.

00:36:32.426 --> 00:36:34.302
Yeah, but like,

00:36:34.303 --> 00:36:38.223
at the same time, not all white kids are all that privileged.

00:36:40.059 --> 00:36:41.225
Uh...

00:36:41.226 --> 00:36:43.227
Like, there's different sorts of privilege.

00:36:43.228 --> 00:36:45.563
You know, like race and class.

00:36:45.564 --> 00:36:47.231
Did you drop your red cap back there, Bri?

00:36:47.232 --> 00:36:48.900
Shut up. You know what I mean.

00:36:58.160 --> 00:36:59.411
You know, I'm promoting you.

00:37:02.623 --> 00:37:03.916
Really?

00:37:04.249 --> 00:37:05.167
I mean, I--

00:37:06.293 --> 00:37:07.211
Don't you think?

00:37:08.379 --> 00:37:09.922
Yeah. Of course.

00:37:11.131 --> 00:37:12.758
So, what? Uh...

00:37:13.258 --> 00:37:14.218
Sergeant?

00:37:14.927 --> 00:37:16.386
You like that?

00:37:16.387 --> 00:37:19.014
Y-Yeah. Thank you, Sheriff.

00:37:21.266 --> 00:37:22.600
You know, I'm actually older than my dad

00:37:22.601 --> 00:37:23.602
when he was Sergeant.

00:37:24.645 --> 00:37:27.564
Well, your dad was Captain

00:37:28.190 --> 00:37:29.400
when I was deputy.

00:37:29.900 --> 00:37:33.028
So, you know, we all got to take these steps.

00:37:34.071 --> 00:37:35.656
He only ever made it to Captain.

00:37:39.451 --> 00:37:41.954
You know, hopefully one day I'll earn Captain, too.

00:37:46.542 --> 00:37:51.797
And, uh, Sheriff, this... this ain't 'cause of the news?

00:37:52.756 --> 00:37:54.008
What news?

00:37:55.884 --> 00:37:57.678
Yeah, cool. Great.

00:38:27.833 --> 00:38:29.292
Hello? Lou?

00:38:29.293 --> 00:38:31.170
...ruin a man's day,

00:38:31.587 --> 00:38:33.047
- or you can do... - Hello?

00:38:34.173 --> 00:38:35.132
Lou?

00:38:46.769 --> 00:38:48.896
And that's why I'm running for Mayor.

00:38:50.355 --> 00:38:51.648
Mayor of Eddington.

00:38:53.776 --> 00:38:56.819
I have, uh, served this county as sheriff

00:38:56.820 --> 00:38:59.030
for seven years, and it has been my honor,

00:38:59.031 --> 00:39:03.076
and I would be honored to serve you as Mayor. Okay?

00:39:03.077 --> 00:39:05.870
And I will continue to fight for you, uh,

00:39:05.871 --> 00:39:07.830
even if it's against the government,

00:39:07.831 --> 00:39:09.624
okay, if that's what that means!

00:39:09.625 --> 00:39:12.710
Uh, because w-we need to stop these lies. Okay?

00:39:12.711 --> 00:39:14.420
We need to reopen our businesses. Okay?

00:39:14.421 --> 00:39:16.047
Covid may be a problem,

00:39:16.048 --> 00:39:18.509
but it certainly ain't our problem.

00:39:19.093 --> 00:39:20.969
Thank you super-duper very much.

00:39:22.137 --> 00:39:24.515
Ladies and gentlemen, what have you, this is--

00:39:44.076 --> 00:39:47.746
The image is true, language is evil.

00:39:48.288 --> 00:39:51.916
Now, your physical body might have been assaulted,

00:39:51.917 --> 00:39:55.336
as mine was. But we are evolving right now.

00:39:55.337 --> 00:39:58.589
And this now is not natural. We are being invaded.

00:39:58.590 --> 00:40:00.424
Human thought is being phased out.

00:40:00.425 --> 00:40:02.802
It is against God, what is happening.

00:40:02.803 --> 00:40:04.303
There is a new God arriving.

00:40:07.766 --> 00:40:08.934
Hey. Hey.

00:40:09.726 --> 00:40:10.893
Where were you?

00:40:10.894 --> 00:40:11.978
You don't tell her what you're doing.

00:40:11.979 --> 00:40:13.104
Lou.

00:40:13.105 --> 00:40:14.939
Why should she tell you?

00:40:14.940 --> 00:40:16.816
Hey. Where were you?

00:40:16.817 --> 00:40:18.234
I took her to a talk by someone

00:40:18.235 --> 00:40:19.152
she actually wanted to listen to.

00:40:19.153 --> 00:40:22.572
Baby, let's-- Ooh.

00:40:22.573 --> 00:40:24.031
This is how you defend her?

00:40:24.032 --> 00:40:25.116
By abandoning your office?

00:40:25.117 --> 00:40:27.160
Lou, come on, open up. Let's talk.

00:40:27.161 --> 00:40:28.495
Has she not gone through enough?

00:40:40.799 --> 00:40:42.301
I was worried about you.

00:40:44.511 --> 00:40:45.596
Where were you?

00:40:51.059 --> 00:40:53.812
I'm doing this for us, Rabbit.

00:40:58.817 --> 00:40:59.693
Okay...

00:41:00.611 --> 00:41:02.361
I should have told you first.

00:41:02.362 --> 00:41:05.031
I just-- I got so excited,

00:41:05.032 --> 00:41:07.576
and I didn't want to overthink it, so I just did it.

00:41:08.160 --> 00:41:11.037
But I should have told you. I'm-I'm sorry. I just--

00:41:11.038 --> 00:41:14.249
This whole town is just lying down,

00:41:15.083 --> 00:41:17.419
and if we see what's happening,

00:41:17.836 --> 00:41:20.171
and we see that it's wrong,

00:41:20.172 --> 00:41:22.966
and we can't see this as an opportunity to...

00:41:24.301 --> 00:41:25.928
to do the right thing.

00:41:27.471 --> 00:41:29.847
We can-- We can bring this place back.

00:41:29.848 --> 00:41:31.558
We can build it back up.

00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:37.689
Lou?

00:41:38.023 --> 00:41:39.649
Did you know

00:41:39.650 --> 00:41:42.151
that this used to be a copper mining town?

00:41:42.152 --> 00:41:43.987
You need to be quiet.

00:41:45.781 --> 00:41:47.031
I'm sorry.

00:41:47.032 --> 00:41:49.868
I don't know how you don't remember what they said.

00:41:50.994 --> 00:41:53.579
About her not having stress,

00:41:53.580 --> 00:41:55.706
about how she can't have stress,

00:41:55.707 --> 00:41:57.083
but I can't.

00:41:57.084 --> 00:41:59.795
So... I'm not being dramatic.

00:42:00.671 --> 00:42:02.589
I cannot slip again.

00:42:03.173 --> 00:42:06.176
Y-You won't slip. I'm gonna catch you.

00:42:08.220 --> 00:42:10.513
People are gonna be looking here now.

00:42:10.514 --> 00:42:12.723
- No, no one's looking. - And sticking their noses in.

00:42:12.724 --> 00:42:14.726
- No. - And shaming her.

00:42:16.186 --> 00:42:18.271
Try to say "me," baby. Not "her."

00:42:18.272 --> 00:42:19.897
You really just don't give a damn

00:42:19.898 --> 00:42:21.899
what happens to his department?

00:42:21.900 --> 00:42:24.902
I mean, you hardly did before. But, I mean--

00:42:24.903 --> 00:42:27.113
I don't want this thing with Ted. You understand?

00:42:27.114 --> 00:42:28.115
Okay.

00:42:29.074 --> 00:42:31.909
This is your thing, and it's Mama's, it's not mine.

00:42:31.910 --> 00:42:34.620
Okay, but I'm-I'm defending you, Rabbit.

00:42:34.621 --> 00:42:36.497
Let the child ventilate.

00:42:36.498 --> 00:42:37.916
Let's have dinner tonight. Okay?

00:42:38.292 --> 00:42:40.251
Baby, I'm your husband,

00:42:40.252 --> 00:42:42.086
and I will not do anything you don't want me to do.

00:42:42.087 --> 00:42:43.838
Your real husband wouldn't have to say "I'm your husband."

00:42:43.839 --> 00:42:44.964
Dawn, please! Okay?

00:42:44.965 --> 00:42:46.257
He'll listen to you, he'll understand you.

00:42:46.258 --> 00:42:48.342
He won't have to wave your vows in your face.

00:42:48.343 --> 00:42:50.177
Let's just get together. You and me.

00:42:50.178 --> 00:42:52.722
We will make a decision together as a team.

00:42:52.723 --> 00:42:55.266
If you want me to retract it, I will.

00:42:55.267 --> 00:42:57.643
Absolutely, no problem.

00:42:57.644 --> 00:43:00.146
Just, yes, you, me, dinner, tonight. Can we?

00:43:00.147 --> 00:43:02.565
- Fine! Fine! - Please? Yes?

00:43:02.566 --> 00:43:05.776
- Just go! - Yes. Okay. Okay. I'm going.

00:43:05.777 --> 00:43:08.780
Dinner tonight. Dinner tonight. Thank you. Thank you.

00:43:11.783 --> 00:43:12.617
Hi!

00:43:20.834 --> 00:43:23.461
If you ever look at the Mayor's Advisory Board...

00:43:23.462 --> 00:43:25.296
Well, that board is actually one man

00:43:25.297 --> 00:43:27.465
and that man is Warren Sandoval.

00:43:27.466 --> 00:43:31.844
Eddington's quote-- "City Economic Development Official."

00:43:31.845 --> 00:43:33.763
And when Mayor Garcia talks,

00:43:33.764 --> 00:43:36.140
it's Sandoval's voice you're hearing.

00:43:36.141 --> 00:43:38.476
But who's Sandoval speaking for?

00:43:38.477 --> 00:43:39.977
It ain't you!

00:43:39.978 --> 00:43:43.981
Maybe it's for your Governor, who he's been on vacation with.

00:43:43.982 --> 00:43:46.692
Maybe it's for the people that got the mayor

00:43:46.693 --> 00:43:49.195
to get that expensive new road built

00:43:49.196 --> 00:43:51.989
out there in the desert, with your money!

00:43:51.990 --> 00:43:53.866
Did you ask for that?

00:43:53.867 --> 00:43:54.992
And did you know

00:43:54.993 --> 00:43:58.037
that it leads out to a top-secret development

00:43:58.038 --> 00:43:59.955
just within the city limits?

00:43:59.956 --> 00:44:01.248
Well, you should!

00:44:01.249 --> 00:44:05.378
They've annexed 800 acres, it has been re-zoned,

00:44:05.379 --> 00:44:07.546
the development and utility agreements

00:44:07.547 --> 00:44:09.548
are getting into place.

00:44:09.549 --> 00:44:12.843
Replacing your businesses with their server farms.

00:44:12.844 --> 00:44:16.180
Solidgoldmagikarp. Look it up.

00:44:16.181 --> 00:44:18.182
This is Deep Learning.

00:44:18.183 --> 00:44:21.560
That is deepfake from the deep state.

00:44:21.561 --> 00:44:22.853
And to whose benefit?

00:44:22.854 --> 00:44:25.398
The same people that always benefit.

00:44:25.399 --> 00:44:26.774
It's not you.

00:44:26.775 --> 00:44:27.691
Bro. Bro, who are you talking to?

00:44:27.692 --> 00:44:29.152
There's nobody here.

00:44:30.445 --> 00:44:32.822
And here we've got an Eddington youngster

00:44:32.823 --> 00:44:34.073
who has yet to join the workforce.

00:44:34.074 --> 00:44:35.741
You should tell them about the time

00:44:35.742 --> 00:44:37.285
my dad dumped your wife.

00:44:41.540 --> 00:44:42.916
The fuck?

00:44:45.377 --> 00:44:46.710
Fucking faggot.

00:44:46.711 --> 00:44:47.920
Shit.

00:44:47.921 --> 00:44:49.922
Hey, do I cut or...

00:44:49.923 --> 00:44:52.758
Yes! Yes! And delete that last part.

00:44:52.759 --> 00:44:53.509
Of course.

00:44:53.510 --> 00:44:54.760
The part with him talking.

00:44:54.761 --> 00:44:55.887
Yep. Yep.

00:44:58.473 --> 00:44:59.557
Fuck you, too.

00:44:59.558 --> 00:45:00.767
- Sheriff! Sheriff! - What?

00:45:02.352 --> 00:45:04.020
Hey, hands up, don't shoot!

00:45:05.981 --> 00:45:06.940
Hello.

00:45:07.774 --> 00:45:09.024
What are we doing here?

00:45:09.025 --> 00:45:10.901
- What is this? - We have a right to assembly.

00:45:10.902 --> 00:45:12.611
Assembly? For-- For what? What are we--

00:45:12.612 --> 00:45:16.699
No justice! No peace! No racist police!

00:45:16.700 --> 00:45:19.452
Racist police? Who?

00:45:19.453 --> 00:45:21.829
A third of my department is fucking--

00:45:21.830 --> 00:45:23.122
Come on, guys.

00:45:23.123 --> 00:45:24.248
Get out the street. You're blocking through traffic.

00:45:24.249 --> 00:45:25.374
We don't need police permission

00:45:25.375 --> 00:45:26.918
to protest police violence, Michael.

00:45:27.669 --> 00:45:29.086
Police violence?

00:45:29.087 --> 00:45:30.797
But what violence are you talking about?

00:45:31.173 --> 00:45:34.675
Now, kids, listen here. This is not legal.

00:45:34.676 --> 00:45:36.260
- So if you could please stand-- - Slavery was legal!

00:45:36.261 --> 00:45:38.387
During slavery it was illegal to free a slave.

00:45:38.388 --> 00:45:39.763
What about the Navajo Long Walk?

00:45:39.764 --> 00:45:40.973
What we did to them and the Apache?

00:45:40.974 --> 00:45:41.974
That's all the same government...

00:45:41.975 --> 00:45:43.476
Okay, you can always tell when somebody's

00:45:43.477 --> 00:45:45.394
learned something new in Social Studies.

00:45:45.395 --> 00:45:46.896
A man was just brutally...

00:45:46.897 --> 00:45:48.814
- Just get on the sidewalk. - ...brutally murdered by a cop.

00:45:48.815 --> 00:45:50.149
That didn't happen here.

00:45:50.150 --> 00:45:51.650
It happened! Is that not enough?

00:45:51.651 --> 00:45:52.693
Fucking traitor!

00:45:52.694 --> 00:45:53.611
This happens all the time!

00:45:53.612 --> 00:45:54.737
Brian, Daniel, Michelle,

00:45:54.738 --> 00:45:56.113
whoever you are, do your parents know...

00:45:56.114 --> 00:45:57.323
Just take this to the sidewalk.

00:45:57.324 --> 00:45:58.992
...you're here making some trouble?

00:45:59.576 --> 00:46:01.827
Okay, I didn't make Covid. Okay?

00:46:01.828 --> 00:46:03.704
I'm not the reason you're all being locked in.

00:46:03.705 --> 00:46:04.831
Call whoever the fuck you want.

00:46:05.332 --> 00:46:07.626
- What? - Call whoever the fuck you want.

00:46:09.628 --> 00:46:11.796
Okay. Uh, listen.

00:46:12.130 --> 00:46:13.964
I'm leaving now for five minutes.

00:46:13.965 --> 00:46:16.091
When I come back, I expect you gone.

00:46:16.092 --> 00:46:18.802
Five minutos. Disperse!

00:46:18.803 --> 00:46:22.390
Michael, you should be with us. Come on.

00:46:24.184 --> 00:46:25.602
Black Lives Matter!

00:46:26.061 --> 00:46:32.566
Black Lives Matter! Black Lives Matter!

00:46:45.539 --> 00:46:48.040
The man identified as George Floyd

00:46:48.041 --> 00:46:49.792
by the lawyer representing his family

00:46:49.793 --> 00:46:52.044
was later pronounced dead at the hospital.

00:46:52.045 --> 00:46:55.339
Today the mayor called it wrong at every level.

00:46:55.340 --> 00:46:59.343
What we saw was horrible and utterly messed up.

00:46:59.344 --> 00:47:02.264
Okay, what was he being detained for in the first place?

00:47:02.806 --> 00:47:04.014
I don't know, but I heard

00:47:04.015 --> 00:47:05.349
something about excited delirium.

00:47:05.350 --> 00:47:06.350
Yeah, exactly.

00:47:06.351 --> 00:47:07.851
Yeah, and what's going to happen when

00:47:07.852 --> 00:47:09.353
they release the footage of him resisting?

00:47:09.354 --> 00:47:10.729
Are they going to get their jobs back?

00:47:10.730 --> 00:47:12.190
So you saw this yesterday?

00:47:14.776 --> 00:47:16.486
Mike, you saw it yesterday?

00:47:17.112 --> 00:47:18.947
- Uh, yeah. - You didn't say anything?

00:47:19.656 --> 00:47:20.906
You okay?

00:47:20.907 --> 00:47:23.701
- I mean, it... - Well...

00:47:23.702 --> 00:47:24.910
It was everywhere.

00:47:27.664 --> 00:47:29.082
Jesus Christ.

00:47:29.833 --> 00:47:31.793
There's already riots in Minneapolis.

00:47:32.419 --> 00:47:33.711
Breaking into stores, stealing shit.

00:47:33.712 --> 00:47:35.170
I mean, what's it going to prove

00:47:35.171 --> 00:47:37.090
if you set your own fucking neighborhood on fire?

00:47:46.349 --> 00:47:47.350
What the--

00:47:47.934 --> 00:47:49.393
"Pig roast"?

00:47:49.394 --> 00:47:51.813
What the fuck are these fuckers doing, man?

00:47:52.272 --> 00:47:53.607
Oh, Jesus Christ.

00:47:54.899 --> 00:47:56.900
Now they're driving into churches?

00:47:56.901 --> 00:48:00.280
Sheriff, look at this. These cops are just letting it happen.

00:48:00.989 --> 00:48:02.740
We got to be ready. They're coming here next.

00:48:02.741 --> 00:48:04.033
- You know they are. - Okay.

00:48:04.034 --> 00:48:06.161
- Bunch of fucking hoodlums-- - All right! Look.

00:48:08.246 --> 00:48:10.456
That's not a here problem. Okay?

00:48:10.457 --> 00:48:14.001
It's-- It's bad. It's an awful tragedy, okay? It's bad.

00:48:14.002 --> 00:48:17.087
But i-i-it's a bad apple that's across the country, okay?

00:48:17.088 --> 00:48:19.882
Now let's just let our kids blow off some steam.

00:48:19.883 --> 00:48:21.134
Michael, are you okay?

00:48:22.469 --> 00:48:23.261
Yeah.

00:48:35.065 --> 00:48:36.399
I got no cash, bro.

00:48:38.151 --> 00:48:39.569
I will make you cash!

00:48:42.572 --> 00:48:43.989
My tooth's infected.

00:48:43.990 --> 00:48:45.825
How many people did you invite?

00:48:46.242 --> 00:48:48.118
There should be more coming.

00:48:48.119 --> 00:48:49.745
Yeah. No, just because there's

00:48:49.746 --> 00:48:51.622
a protest at the Round House in Santa Fe,

00:48:51.623 --> 00:48:54.166
and that's where we should actually be.

00:48:54.167 --> 00:48:55.459
Like we've got to be careful.

00:48:55.460 --> 00:48:57.379
We can't just feel happy with ourselves.

00:48:57.754 --> 00:49:00.423
Yeah. I mean, I obviously agree with that.

00:49:01.049 --> 00:49:03.550
Yeah, and sorry, but you called yourself anti-racist earlier,

00:49:03.551 --> 00:49:06.178
and we can't just take that.

00:49:06.179 --> 00:49:07.763
Like, do you know what that would actually

00:49:07.764 --> 00:49:09.390
take and mean?

00:49:09.391 --> 00:49:11.767
Because I'm not an anti-racist either, but right now

00:49:11.768 --> 00:49:14.770
we're playing at maybe being, like, White Critical.

00:49:14.771 --> 00:49:16.188
Maybe we're White Traitors,

00:49:16.189 --> 00:49:19.692
but the goal is to be White Abolitionists.

00:49:19.693 --> 00:49:21.193
And that means actually--

00:49:21.194 --> 00:49:24.154
...changing institutions, dismantling whiteness

00:49:24.155 --> 00:49:26.990
and not allowing whiteness to reassert itself.

00:49:26.991 --> 00:49:30.412
But we're pretty much light-years away from that.

00:49:34.999 --> 00:49:36.960
Are you fucking retarded?

00:49:37.711 --> 00:49:39.878
What the fuck are you talking about?

00:49:39.879 --> 00:49:41.339
You're white.

00:49:41.715 --> 00:49:43.674
And that really gets it nice and creamy.

00:49:43.675 --> 00:49:47.010
Let's put in some olives, so that we build the flavor.

00:49:47.011 --> 00:49:49.346
Oh, yeah. All of it. That's great.

00:49:49.347 --> 00:49:52.142
Capers. You like capers? I like capers.

00:49:53.476 --> 00:49:55.185
Remember to film Mikey's promotion

00:49:55.186 --> 00:49:57.564
and to put it on TikTok or whatever--

00:49:58.398 --> 00:49:59.315
Whoa.

00:50:05.029 --> 00:50:06.029
Before you vote,

00:50:06.030 --> 00:50:07.740
remember Schott Solar...

00:50:07.741 --> 00:50:10.868
60 million dollars in grants in the garbage.

00:50:10.869 --> 00:50:12.578
Those were the same kind of high-interest

00:50:12.579 --> 00:50:14.705
bonds he's bragging about here.

00:50:14.706 --> 00:50:16.207
All right, council member Garcia moves to--

00:50:28.011 --> 00:50:29.720
It's multi-generational.

00:50:29.721 --> 00:50:30.888
You commit suicide,

00:50:30.889 --> 00:50:32.848
you can't be buried in the Mossad cemetery,

00:50:32.849 --> 00:50:34.433
so why's he there

00:50:34.434 --> 00:50:37.227
if not as a message to say "It wasn't suicide, we killed him"?

00:50:42.066 --> 00:50:42.734
Joe?

00:50:44.360 --> 00:50:46.029
This is the son-in-law.

00:50:47.489 --> 00:50:49.532
- Joe? - Yeah. Hey.

00:50:50.074 --> 00:50:51.116
I am so sorry.

00:50:51.117 --> 00:50:53.202
- Oh, yeah. Here we go. - I texted you,

00:50:53.203 --> 00:50:54.703
but it never went through, I guess.

00:50:54.704 --> 00:50:57.207
And a bouquet. Sheep's clothing.

00:50:58.249 --> 00:51:00.042
- So sorry. - Hi, there.

00:51:00.043 --> 00:51:02.419
Son-in-law? Husband?

00:51:02.420 --> 00:51:04.339
Sheriff? Mayor?

00:51:05.006 --> 00:51:06.507
Well, mayor-to-be.

00:51:06.508 --> 00:51:09.927
Well, we'll see. Yeah. Joe Cross.

00:51:09.928 --> 00:51:11.762
Sorry. I'm-- Hello, I'm Vernon.

00:51:11.763 --> 00:51:13.306
- Vernon. - Yeah.

00:51:14.307 --> 00:51:15.099
Oh.

00:51:16.142 --> 00:51:17.602
J-Jefferson Peak?

00:51:18.102 --> 00:51:18.853
Yes.

00:51:24.108 --> 00:51:25.109
How you doing?

00:51:25.777 --> 00:51:27.277
I'm Joe. This is my home.

00:51:27.278 --> 00:51:28.612
- This... - Uh-huh.

00:51:28.613 --> 00:51:30.906
is Nicolette and her husband Will.

00:51:30.907 --> 00:51:33.660
Are you kids hungry? How much did you make?

00:51:34.619 --> 00:51:36.787
Well, enough for two.

00:51:38.039 --> 00:51:40.458
It's cold. That's too bad.

00:51:44.963 --> 00:51:46.171
Please sit down.

00:51:46.172 --> 00:51:47.297
Please. Would you like to sit down?

00:51:47.298 --> 00:51:48.216
Thank you.

00:51:48.925 --> 00:51:50.927
You guys sit.

00:51:51.970 --> 00:51:54.513
Uh, well, where are you all coming from?

00:51:54.514 --> 00:51:55.514
A potluck.

00:51:55.515 --> 00:51:57.140
With no food.

00:52:02.647 --> 00:52:04.649
Well, can I offer you, um...

00:52:05.900 --> 00:52:08.485
something? Some... Anything?

00:52:08.486 --> 00:52:10.196
No, no. We're stuffed.

00:52:11.155 --> 00:52:11.990
You mind if I...

00:52:21.291 --> 00:52:22.708
These are amazing.

00:52:22.709 --> 00:52:24.419
Yeah, those are all Lou.

00:52:26.963 --> 00:52:29.841
She's been making them just like that since she was ten.

00:52:31.342 --> 00:52:32.635
Since you were ten.

00:52:34.012 --> 00:52:35.429
Oh, it's just a hobby.

00:52:35.430 --> 00:52:37.264
Everybody needs one.

00:52:37.265 --> 00:52:38.682
The worst times in my life is when

00:52:38.683 --> 00:52:41.059
I fell out of function with my hobbies.

00:52:41.060 --> 00:52:43.521
Yeah, and they've been selling really good, too.

00:52:46.232 --> 00:52:47.442
That one must be new.

00:52:47.817 --> 00:52:50.028
Oh, it's-- it's been there for a month.

00:52:51.946 --> 00:52:54.532
God is speaking through you.

00:52:59.871 --> 00:53:01.623
I'm sorry.

00:53:06.294 --> 00:53:09.088
That's Lou's father. The original sheriff.

00:53:09.714 --> 00:53:11.549
He passed away seven years ago.

00:53:12.926 --> 00:53:14.052
You were with him.

00:53:15.678 --> 00:53:18.723
His heart just stopped in his chest, apparently.

00:53:20.516 --> 00:53:22.268
Who knows if he could have actually made it?

00:53:23.603 --> 00:53:24.479
I do.

00:53:25.939 --> 00:53:29.025
When my dad died, my brain completely reset.

00:53:30.401 --> 00:53:33.362
He was a civil engineer in DC, working for the government.

00:53:33.363 --> 00:53:35.864
Just like you're about to, right? When you win?

00:53:35.865 --> 00:53:37.992
Well, not-- not for the government.

00:53:38.785 --> 00:53:39.786
For the people.

00:53:40.411 --> 00:53:41.287
Is the idea.

00:53:42.372 --> 00:53:45.457
Your brain reset how?

00:53:45.458 --> 00:53:46.417
What does that mean?

00:53:47.293 --> 00:53:48.544
Breakdown.

00:53:49.087 --> 00:53:51.880
It took five years experimental therapy

00:53:51.881 --> 00:53:54.717
to unlock even just fragments of memories.

00:53:56.094 --> 00:53:58.680
Some of which were that I'd been very effectively brainwashed.

00:53:59.597 --> 00:54:00.765
We talked about this.

00:54:02.892 --> 00:54:05.561
Um... What were the memories?

00:54:10.233 --> 00:54:12.818
The memories are of being gifted off

00:54:12.819 --> 00:54:15.196
by my father, to his colleagues.

00:54:16.906 --> 00:54:19.117
Who exactly they were, I don't know.

00:54:19.742 --> 00:54:21.327
I do know there were ten other kids,

00:54:22.453 --> 00:54:23.996
and we were taken to a private forest grove

00:54:23.997 --> 00:54:25.372
in Northern California

00:54:25.373 --> 00:54:30.086
where we were stripped nude and photographed and...

00:54:31.045 --> 00:54:32.672
things I hope you can't imagine.

00:54:33.923 --> 00:54:36.968
And then they released us, and they hunted us down.

00:54:37.510 --> 00:54:39.554
And I escaped.

00:54:40.179 --> 00:54:41.514
I was the only one to escape.

00:54:42.890 --> 00:54:47.394
And those are my memories, which are now extremely vivid.

00:54:47.395 --> 00:54:49.771
So if they were hunting you down,

00:54:49.772 --> 00:54:52.567
why would they release you?

00:54:53.401 --> 00:54:56.070
The game was to catch us.

00:54:58.197 --> 00:54:59.907
Well, okay.

00:55:00.783 --> 00:55:04.370
Um, I want to be respectful here.

00:55:05.413 --> 00:55:08.498
Um, but I-I just-- I don't understand.

00:55:08.499 --> 00:55:10.876
I mean, you-- Who did this?

00:55:10.877 --> 00:55:14.546
And... ...you were the only one to escape?

00:55:14.547 --> 00:55:15.797
You say you were a child.

00:55:15.798 --> 00:55:17.925
Your question is to make me feel shame.

00:55:19.177 --> 00:55:21.095
I didn't escape on my own. I couldn't have.

00:55:23.473 --> 00:55:27.602
Joe, you want things simple and neat.

00:55:28.978 --> 00:55:31.063
You think that because something's evil,

00:55:31.064 --> 00:55:32.398
there can't be love.

00:55:34.025 --> 00:55:35.318
When there is love,

00:55:36.527 --> 00:55:37.904
that's the slavery.

00:55:39.489 --> 00:55:40.865
And evil is sentimental.

00:55:41.866 --> 00:55:43.492
And a predator can fall in love.

00:55:43.493 --> 00:55:45.036
And he can help his victim escape.

00:55:46.287 --> 00:55:47.872
And I can't say his name...

00:55:50.708 --> 00:55:52.876
But they called his death an overdose

00:55:52.877 --> 00:55:54.795
just five days after he let me go

00:55:54.796 --> 00:55:56.630
and my father, who sold me,

00:55:56.631 --> 00:55:59.216
committed "suicide" that same week.

00:55:59.217 --> 00:56:00.342
I understand.

00:56:00.343 --> 00:56:02.427
It is unbelievable. It sounds insane to me,

00:56:02.428 --> 00:56:04.262
just hearing it coming out of my own mouth.

00:56:04.263 --> 00:56:06.264
My brain still hasn't truly accepted

00:56:06.265 --> 00:56:08.559
that I'm actually talking about things that happened to me.

00:56:11.229 --> 00:56:12.772
Yes, it is, um,

00:56:15.775 --> 00:56:16.943
hard to believe.

00:56:17.568 --> 00:56:18.277
And...

00:56:22.949 --> 00:56:25.867
I mean, I'm sorry. I cannot imagine...

00:56:25.868 --> 00:56:28.703
You can imagine. You know it.

00:56:28.704 --> 00:56:30.539
It's easier to not get it.

00:56:30.540 --> 00:56:31.624
It's evil.

00:56:34.085 --> 00:56:35.753
Your father was sentimental.

00:56:37.463 --> 00:56:38.631
Oh.

00:56:39.090 --> 00:56:42.092
What does that mean?

00:56:42.093 --> 00:56:43.510
We are in a fight against evil.

00:56:43.511 --> 00:56:45.303
And part of that is fighting against denial

00:56:45.304 --> 00:56:46.430
and denying denial.

00:56:46.764 --> 00:56:48.557
Now I just told you my story.

00:56:48.558 --> 00:56:50.642
Will and Nicolette helped each other

00:56:50.643 --> 00:56:52.769
escape a ten-by-ten foot cellar

00:56:52.770 --> 00:56:54.271
when they were pre-teens.

00:56:54.272 --> 00:56:55.773
You go to Brussels next week.

00:56:57.233 --> 00:56:58.692
Their testimony's under review

00:56:58.693 --> 00:57:00.777
by the International Common Law Court of Justice.

00:57:00.778 --> 00:57:01.571
Evil!

00:57:02.738 --> 00:57:04.072
If you want to know a society,

00:57:04.073 --> 00:57:06.159
you look at what it does to its children.

00:57:06.742 --> 00:57:09.703
What you two went through? What your daddy did?

00:57:09.704 --> 00:57:12.581
Lou. Sometimes, baby, it's just to listen.

00:57:12.582 --> 00:57:14.417
You cannot just ignore!

00:57:15.418 --> 00:57:18.628
The average pedophile abuses between 50 and 100 children

00:57:18.629 --> 00:57:20.922
in their lifetime! Per abuser!

00:57:20.923 --> 00:57:23.216
And they keep these kids quiet

00:57:23.217 --> 00:57:25.844
so that they think that it's just-- It's only them.

00:57:25.845 --> 00:57:29.139
That it's this rare thing that only happens to them.

00:57:29.140 --> 00:57:32.684
And they do fill these kids with shame because they--

00:57:32.685 --> 00:57:34.186
they want them to never even ask,

00:57:34.187 --> 00:57:35.687
or never even realize

00:57:35.688 --> 00:57:37.939
that maybe this happens so much

00:57:37.940 --> 00:57:41.151
because there is this whole entire network,

00:57:41.152 --> 00:57:43.153
that maybe all these demons

00:57:43.154 --> 00:57:45.698
- are in league with each other-- - Okay. Okay! That's enough!

00:57:46.991 --> 00:57:49.076
I don't even know what this is. I can't-- No.

00:57:49.869 --> 00:57:51.328
Last night was the same thing.

00:57:51.329 --> 00:57:53.330
I've had two hours sleep in two days.

00:57:53.331 --> 00:57:56.333
I'm sorry, I can't just let you turn this

00:57:56.334 --> 00:57:58.835
- into a free-for-all. - You know what that is.

00:58:00.087 --> 00:58:01.589
It's at herself.

00:58:09.972 --> 00:58:10.973
It's late.

00:58:12.266 --> 00:58:13.517
I'm just going to wash this.

00:58:40.586 --> 00:58:41.504
Hey.

00:58:44.548 --> 00:58:45.508
Hm?

00:58:51.055 --> 00:58:52.682
Can I ask you something?

00:58:54.558 --> 00:58:55.768
Hm?

00:58:57.395 --> 00:58:59.814
I-I've been meaning to ask you...

00:59:01.065 --> 00:59:03.484
And-- And I won't ever again.

00:59:06.529 --> 00:59:10.491
All those things that you were saying outside?

00:59:11.075 --> 00:59:13.619
Uh, all those things that you...

00:59:15.246 --> 00:59:17.080
...the things you were saying earlier?

00:59:24.213 --> 00:59:26.382
Did your dad...

00:59:29.427 --> 00:59:34.015
Did your dad... ever... t--

00:59:36.642 --> 00:59:38.977
Or... Or... Or...

00:59:38.978 --> 00:59:40.646
Or was it Ted?

00:59:40.980 --> 00:59:42.064
Was it Ted?

00:59:42.690 --> 00:59:44.274
Was that what it was?

00:59:44.275 --> 00:59:45.401
Was it Ted?

00:59:46.193 --> 00:59:47.820
Is that what it is?

01:01:13.197 --> 01:01:14.364
Hello. Yeah.

01:01:14.365 --> 01:01:15.365
Sheriff, the riots, they're here.

01:01:15.366 --> 01:01:16.408
They're on Broadway, right outside.

01:01:16.409 --> 01:01:17.575
What? Where? Where?

01:01:17.576 --> 01:01:19.328
- You got to get over here. - What? Where? Where?

01:01:19.870 --> 01:01:21.079
They're on Broadway. They're right outside.

01:01:21.080 --> 01:01:22.790
We-- We could use your help over here.

01:01:23.833 --> 01:01:26.376
- Hello? - Where the hell are you?

01:01:26.377 --> 01:01:28.211
All my goddamn windows smashed to hell,

01:01:28.212 --> 01:01:29.379
and I can't get a--

01:01:29.380 --> 01:01:30.422
We got to just, obviously,

01:01:30.423 --> 01:01:31.798
cancel this town hall.

01:01:31.799 --> 01:01:33.842
- No. That is not obvious, Paula. - Yes, it is.

01:01:33.843 --> 01:01:35.552
This is a blip. We will disperse it.

01:01:35.553 --> 01:01:36.636
What's a blip?

01:01:36.637 --> 01:01:38.346
Oh, no, my signs.

01:01:38.347 --> 01:01:39.431
What's wrong?

01:01:39.432 --> 01:01:42.350
Jesus!

01:01:42.351 --> 01:01:45.145
Nothing. Dog in the road. Dog in the road. Uh--

01:01:45.146 --> 01:01:47.063
Damn. Uh, I'll call you back.

01:01:47.064 --> 01:01:47.981
What?

01:01:53.112 --> 01:01:54.320
The cops and the Klan

01:01:54.321 --> 01:01:55.738
go hand in hand.

01:01:55.739 --> 01:02:00.910
The cops and the Klan go hand in hand.

01:02:20.097 --> 01:02:21.181
Why aren't you out there?

01:02:21.182 --> 01:02:22.098
I was, but they're filming.

01:02:22.099 --> 01:02:23.308
Why do I even fucking have you guys?

01:02:23.309 --> 01:02:24.601
They're trying to use us being out there

01:02:24.602 --> 01:02:25.560
- to make it worse. - Sheriff, I know. Okay?

01:02:25.561 --> 01:02:27.645
I'm the one with the speech tonight.

01:02:27.646 --> 01:02:30.315
But my two deputies, whose only job is this...

01:02:30.316 --> 01:02:31.566
But Sheriff, I did--

01:02:31.567 --> 01:02:33.151
...but how is it that I'm the one...

01:02:33.152 --> 01:02:34.444
- ...going out there? - I did go out there.

01:02:34.445 --> 01:02:35.987
We went out there. We both went out there.

01:02:35.988 --> 01:02:37.155
Sheriff, there's been new information,

01:02:37.156 --> 01:02:38.531
and it changes the way we engage.

01:02:38.532 --> 01:02:40.492
It's simple, but you got to see it.

01:02:40.493 --> 01:02:42.202
Sheriff, they're just trying to piss us off

01:02:42.203 --> 01:02:44.287
so they can film us and use it against us.

01:02:49.126 --> 01:02:50.794
I know, Sheriff, it's going to be fine.

01:02:58.302 --> 01:02:59.302
No!

01:02:59.303 --> 01:03:00.803
Ain't nobody coming to protect us.

01:03:00.804 --> 01:03:02.263
We got to start our own--

01:03:02.264 --> 01:03:03.431
Shut the--

01:03:03.432 --> 01:03:06.100
- Oh. You see it's not at all... - Mike.

01:03:06.101 --> 01:03:08.561
- ...like fascists in Michigan. - Do you understand this?

01:03:08.562 --> 01:03:10.605
Do I understand what, Tooley?

01:03:10.606 --> 01:03:12.273
I just know you were dealing with it yesterday,

01:03:12.274 --> 01:03:13.650
and I'm wondering why it's ten times bigger today.

01:03:13.651 --> 01:03:14.859
Yeah, with the Sheriff.

01:03:14.860 --> 01:03:16.152
And it's ten times bigger everywhere.

01:03:16.153 --> 01:03:17.320
What the fuck?

01:03:17.321 --> 01:03:18.988
Yeah, don't on purpose misunderstand me, man.

01:03:18.989 --> 01:03:20.698
I'm just asking you a normal question.

01:03:20.699 --> 01:03:22.367
What is going on?

01:03:22.368 --> 01:03:25.703
There is a riot happening right in front of your faces,

01:03:25.704 --> 01:03:27.873
- and you're checking your email? - I know! I know!

01:03:29.959 --> 01:03:31.376
Sheriff, when we go in there,

01:03:31.377 --> 01:03:32.502
we're going to need a direction of clearing,

01:03:32.503 --> 01:03:34.003
a direction of movement.

01:03:34.004 --> 01:03:37.215
Look, we cannot let Paula shut down the town hall. Please.

01:03:37.216 --> 01:03:38.383
It's too important.

01:03:38.384 --> 01:03:39.509
Sheriff, the state police say

01:03:39.510 --> 01:03:40.802
they have no more available units.

01:03:40.803 --> 01:03:42.470
They've deployed everybody to Albuquerque.

01:03:42.471 --> 01:03:46.516
Listen. Stay cool. Okay? And stay together.

01:03:46.517 --> 01:03:47.726
Yes, sir.

01:03:57.194 --> 01:04:00.238
Step over to the side for your own safety, okay?

01:04:00.239 --> 01:04:01.698
Our priority is your safety!

01:04:01.699 --> 01:04:03.032
Step back.

01:04:03.033 --> 01:04:05.661
- Please step out of the road! - We understand your frustration.

01:04:06.829 --> 01:04:09.664
We're trying to keep you safe. Can you relax?

01:04:09.665 --> 01:04:11.541
Hey! You can't do that! Hey!

01:04:11.542 --> 01:04:14.210
Hey, back it up! Back it up! Hey, can you stop?

01:04:14.211 --> 01:04:15.420
We understand what side you're on.

01:04:15.421 --> 01:04:17.046
If you're gonna help, stand over here, okay?

01:04:17.047 --> 01:04:19.882
Everybody, for your own safety,

01:04:19.883 --> 01:04:22.176
please get out of the street!

01:04:22.177 --> 01:04:25.054
- We're a peaceful protest. - You do not have a permit.

01:04:25.055 --> 01:04:26.264
We don't need a permit.

01:04:26.265 --> 01:04:28.016
Yes. You go to the county commissioner's office.

01:04:28.017 --> 01:04:29.225
We appreciate your service,

01:04:29.226 --> 01:04:31.102
but we do not need you guys today.

01:04:31.103 --> 01:04:32.395
You need to have a permit

01:04:32.396 --> 01:04:33.896
in order to be here in the middle of the street.

01:04:33.897 --> 01:04:35.064
Actually, this is public property.

01:04:35.065 --> 01:04:35.940
It's not safe--

01:04:35.941 --> 01:04:37.400
Are you a lawyer or something?

01:04:37.401 --> 01:04:39.110
- This is public property... - Get up out of the--

01:04:39.111 --> 01:04:42.363
...and the First Amendment says we do have the right to convene.

01:04:43.407 --> 01:04:46.117
Our institutions are protecting murder!

01:04:46.118 --> 01:04:49.120
Does your dad know that you're out here creating this circus?

01:04:49.121 --> 01:04:50.622
We're talking right now on stolen land.

01:04:50.623 --> 01:04:51.706
Stolen land!

01:04:51.707 --> 01:04:52.957
Whose stolen land? Stolen from who?

01:04:52.958 --> 01:04:54.834
Yeah, and we're calling for the defunding and abolition

01:04:54.835 --> 01:04:56.544
of the corrupt and homicidal police state.

01:04:56.545 --> 01:04:57.920
Defunding?

01:04:57.921 --> 01:04:59.631
What are you talking about? Do you want to see my budget?

01:04:59.632 --> 01:05:01.215
Yeah, I would-- Don't put your fucking hand on me!

01:05:01.216 --> 01:05:02.634
I'll put my hand where I want.

01:05:02.635 --> 01:05:04.761
Now listen here, you little son of a bitch. aaaa

01:05:04.762 --> 01:05:05.970
What the fuck?

01:05:05.971 --> 01:05:07.722
Okay? You just need to shut the fuck up!

01:05:13.270 --> 01:05:16.022
Sheriff, look at this!

01:05:16.023 --> 01:05:17.483
Look what they done.

01:05:18.233 --> 01:05:20.193
Thousands of dollars in goods they took.

01:05:20.194 --> 01:05:22.946
John, I know. Now...

01:05:23.572 --> 01:05:25.615
Maybe you shouldn't put racist fucking

01:05:25.616 --> 01:05:28.743
lawn jockeys in your racist fucking store!

01:05:28.744 --> 01:05:30.662
You fucking Nazi!

01:05:30.663 --> 01:05:34.248
I'm a Nazi? You're fucking destroying property!

01:05:34.249 --> 01:05:37.001
Gloria? Oh, my God, baby, it's me.

01:05:37.002 --> 01:05:38.753
- Baby, it's Daddy. It's Daddy! - Get the fuck away from me!

01:05:38.754 --> 01:05:40.254
- Who the fuck are you? - I'm so sorry.

01:05:40.255 --> 01:05:42.632
- Get the fuck away from me! - They took you!

01:05:42.633 --> 01:05:44.801
They took you from me!

01:05:44.802 --> 01:05:47.136
It's not my fault, they took you from me.

01:05:47.137 --> 01:05:48.638
Michael.

01:05:48.639 --> 01:05:50.640
Do you just not even care about what happened?

01:05:50.641 --> 01:05:52.810
I'm seriously asking you, not as a cop.

01:05:53.769 --> 01:05:55.353
- Seriously. - Yeah, it's an outrage.

01:05:55.354 --> 01:05:56.562
It's a horrible incident.

01:05:56.563 --> 01:05:58.231
Nobody hates fucking bad cops more than cops.

01:05:58.232 --> 01:06:01.317
Bad cops? Evil fucking racist cops!

01:06:01.318 --> 01:06:02.777
You're wearing the uniform of a system

01:06:02.778 --> 01:06:04.904
built on hundreds of years of institutionalized racism!

01:06:04.905 --> 01:06:06.364
You know you got Aryan Nation boys with you?

01:06:06.365 --> 01:06:07.365
- You know that, right? - No! Fuck off! Michael.

01:06:07.366 --> 01:06:09.075
Your family is fuckin' ashamed of you!

01:06:09.076 --> 01:06:12.120
Michael, not that. Can I just say something?

01:06:12.121 --> 01:06:15.498
You should be joining us! Do you even know why you aren't?

01:06:15.499 --> 01:06:18.584
This is-- I know I have not experienced racism,

01:06:18.585 --> 01:06:20.545
but you-- you have!

01:06:20.546 --> 01:06:22.797
This is not my place! This is not my fight!

01:06:22.798 --> 01:06:24.382
I am a hypocrite.

01:06:24.383 --> 01:06:26.217
I know that, but all I can do

01:06:26.218 --> 01:06:29.345
is stand here and fight for justice!

01:06:29.346 --> 01:06:31.848
- So stand with us! - Do us all a favor.

01:06:31.849 --> 01:06:33.391
- I am so serious. - Can you take a kneel?

01:06:33.392 --> 01:06:34.642
Shut up. No.

01:06:34.643 --> 01:06:36.519
Guy, do not engage!

01:06:36.520 --> 01:06:38.730
Listen, you've got to protect Paula's.

01:06:38.731 --> 01:06:40.231
They're wrecking everything, okay?

01:06:40.232 --> 01:06:41.441
Get over there, right now!

01:06:41.442 --> 01:06:43.067
- That is our priority. - Yes, sir.

01:06:48.365 --> 01:06:50.659
Police violence in Eddington!

01:06:51.535 --> 01:06:57.665
Police violence in Eddington! Police violence in Eddington!

01:06:57.666 --> 01:07:00.669
Do you even know what your dad really is?

01:07:01.170 --> 01:07:03.005
Do you know what he has done?

01:07:03.881 --> 01:07:05.007
You mean to your wife?

01:07:06.508 --> 01:07:07.885
- What? - What?

01:07:08.969 --> 01:07:10.553
What about your mother?

01:07:10.554 --> 01:07:12.597
Where is she? Huh?

01:07:12.598 --> 01:07:14.183
Do you ask these questions?

01:07:14.725 --> 01:07:16.893
What about your fucking crazy whore wife?

01:07:16.894 --> 01:07:18.603
Her batshit mom sending crazy shit

01:07:18.604 --> 01:07:20.229
to my house my whole life!

01:07:20.230 --> 01:07:21.898
Maybe that had something to do with it!

01:07:25.903 --> 01:07:29.989
I was just trying to explain the situation here.

01:07:29.990 --> 01:07:32.658
Okay? Everything is-- Everybody calm down!

01:07:32.659 --> 01:07:37.413
Everyone! 8 minutes and 46 seconds on the ground now.

01:07:37.414 --> 01:07:38.499
Calm down!

01:07:40.918 --> 01:07:43.253
Yeah. Now this is how you do a protest.

01:07:47.674 --> 01:07:49.967
John, I will be right back.

01:07:49.968 --> 01:07:51.385
Yeah, right.

01:07:51.386 --> 01:07:52.554
Were you even here?

01:07:54.932 --> 01:07:56.140
Okay.

01:07:56.141 --> 01:07:57.809
Hey, what these people want...

01:07:57.810 --> 01:07:59.644
- Pardon me. - ...will not stop.

01:07:59.645 --> 01:08:01.270
This is a good message.

01:08:01.271 --> 01:08:05.191
This is good. Peaceful. No more violence.

01:08:05.192 --> 01:08:06.442
It doesn't end until they pull you

01:08:06.443 --> 01:08:07.610
out of your bed in the middle of the night...

01:08:07.611 --> 01:08:08.778
No violence, just peace.

01:08:08.779 --> 01:08:09.987
...and who are you going to call?

01:08:09.988 --> 01:08:11.280
- But the violence... - What the hell?

01:08:11.281 --> 01:08:13.449
...the violence just angers me.

01:08:13.450 --> 01:08:14.659
You want to defund the police?

01:08:14.660 --> 01:08:16.828
There won't be any police there to call.

01:08:16.829 --> 01:08:18.162
Hell yeah, brother.

01:08:18.163 --> 01:08:21.791
And if the people go home and get their guns and come in,

01:08:21.792 --> 01:08:25.586
and the threat sees this, they will leave.

01:08:25.587 --> 01:08:26.963
They will leave.

01:08:26.964 --> 01:08:28.507
- Go home and think about it. - Peaceful!

01:08:28.841 --> 01:08:32.134
Shit, shit, shit. Fucking shit.

01:08:34.137 --> 01:08:35.304
Yes. Okay.

01:08:35.305 --> 01:08:36.974
Yes. Damn.

01:08:37.975 --> 01:08:40.184
Hey there, everyone. Hey.

01:08:40.185 --> 01:08:43.688
Well, this is nice to see. Finally, huh?

01:08:43.689 --> 01:08:44.856
Dining together.

01:08:44.857 --> 01:08:47.358
Community. I almost forgot what this was like.

01:08:47.359 --> 01:08:50.528
Paula, thank you so much for opening it up.

01:08:50.529 --> 01:08:52.865
It's so good to see everybody. Yeah.

01:08:53.282 --> 01:08:55.450
Hey there, Ralph. It's, uh...

01:08:56.034 --> 01:08:58.036
Real good to see everyone. Hey.

01:08:59.162 --> 01:08:59.955
Um...

01:09:02.207 --> 01:09:03.584
Well...

01:09:04.543 --> 01:09:05.836
Uh...

01:09:08.755 --> 01:09:12.133
I was hoping for a better turnout.

01:09:12.134 --> 01:09:13.010
But, um...

01:09:15.512 --> 01:09:17.430
But how's anyone supposed to get here

01:09:17.431 --> 01:09:19.266
when you got to wade through that?

01:09:20.267 --> 01:09:23.687
And my deputies are-are keeping it safe.

01:09:24.605 --> 01:09:25.647
Uh...

01:09:27.190 --> 01:09:30.568
And yes, these protests, it's a real thing, okay?

01:09:30.569 --> 01:09:33.279
There is an imbalance in this country.

01:09:33.280 --> 01:09:35.698
And what happened to that man... undefensible.

01:09:35.699 --> 01:09:38.326
Absolutely disgraceful conduct.

01:09:38.327 --> 01:09:40.870
But I am not the problem here. Okay?

01:09:40.871 --> 01:09:42.497
And if-- if you believe that...

01:09:43.248 --> 01:09:47.002
d-do you really think that the power is with the police?

01:09:48.670 --> 01:09:50.296
It's the leadership.

01:09:50.297 --> 01:09:54.717
The-- The power is with the leadership of this country

01:09:54.718 --> 01:09:58.679
on down to the leadership of this community.

01:09:58.680 --> 01:10:01.850
Okay? Now do you want to talk about brutality?

01:10:03.352 --> 01:10:07.063
I have kept this town safe for the better half of my life,

01:10:07.064 --> 01:10:12.944
but if there is one thing that I feel shame about,

01:10:12.945 --> 01:10:16.280
truly, it is in keeping quiet

01:10:16.281 --> 01:10:19.910
about something that I shouldn't have.

01:10:20.577 --> 01:10:22.870
Okay? About Ted Garcia.

01:10:22.871 --> 01:10:24.039
Our mayor.

01:10:24.581 --> 01:10:27.375
Because the man is...

01:10:27.376 --> 01:10:29.920
purely and simply...

01:10:32.422 --> 01:10:34.383
a predator.

01:10:36.426 --> 01:10:41.014
Okay? Yes. Ted Garcia is a sexual predator.

01:10:42.599 --> 01:10:46.227
I know. I see your faces. I know, okay?

01:10:46.228 --> 01:10:47.478
How do I know this?

01:10:47.479 --> 01:10:49.690
Well, I should know this.

01:10:50.273 --> 01:10:53.985
My wife, when she was 16 years old--

01:10:53.986 --> 01:10:56.153
he gets her pregnant.

01:10:56.154 --> 01:10:58.406
Forces her to abort.

01:10:58.407 --> 01:11:02.077
Tiny little innocent baby. Murdered.

01:11:02.703 --> 01:11:06.081
And Ted turns his back. Her life is ruined.

01:11:06.623 --> 01:11:10.126
Ted's life? Ooh. Well, he's off to the races.

01:11:10.127 --> 01:11:11.503
And for what?

01:11:12.754 --> 01:11:15.673
Well, you vote him back into office,

01:11:15.674 --> 01:11:17.634
and you're going to find out for what.

01:11:18.510 --> 01:11:21.804
Okay? And you look to his own wife.

01:11:21.805 --> 01:11:23.931
But you can't. Why?

01:11:23.932 --> 01:11:25.683
Because she's gone. Took off.

01:11:25.684 --> 01:11:27.810
Okay, now that is none of my business.

01:11:27.811 --> 01:11:30.187
I can only speculate why.

01:11:30.188 --> 01:11:32.523
But let me tell you something. You look to history.

01:11:32.524 --> 01:11:36.152
And what that man did to my wife, my darling...

01:11:37.696 --> 01:11:40.114
Let me tell you something. That is predator behavior.

01:11:40.115 --> 01:11:43.994
It is, okay? And what's worse...

01:11:44.619 --> 01:11:45.704
is it's...

01:11:48.373 --> 01:11:49.207
It's...

01:11:52.127 --> 01:11:53.170
It's rape.

01:11:54.379 --> 01:11:55.922
Let's call it what it is.

01:11:56.965 --> 01:11:58.508
Let's face it. Statutory.

01:12:00.177 --> 01:12:03.305
Ted Garcia. Let's call him what he is.

01:12:03.805 --> 01:12:05.181
And we're saying it,

01:12:05.182 --> 01:12:08.976
and we're going to be saying it in the days and the weeks ahead.

01:12:08.977 --> 01:12:11.520
Because that is what this election is about.

01:12:11.521 --> 01:12:14.941
So you vote Joe Cross. Take back our community.

01:12:17.569 --> 01:12:19.237
Save our soul.

01:12:26.787 --> 01:12:27.746
Thank you.

01:12:28.163 --> 01:12:29.790
Wow. Good?

01:12:30.582 --> 01:12:31.874
Post it.

01:12:31.875 --> 01:12:33.418
Okay. You sure?

01:12:35.253 --> 01:12:37.172
Just don't make me think. Post it.

01:12:38.590 --> 01:12:40.132
Stand up, fight back!

01:12:40.133 --> 01:12:41.634
- What do we want? - Justice!

01:12:41.635 --> 01:12:43.385
- When do we want it? - Now!

01:12:43.386 --> 01:12:44.929
If we don't get it...

01:12:44.930 --> 01:12:46.388
Shut it down!

01:12:46.389 --> 01:12:48.057
If we don't get it...

01:12:48.058 --> 01:12:56.817
Shut it down! Shut it down!

01:13:07.869 --> 01:13:09.411
...did not let Ethereum's price fall

01:13:09.412 --> 01:13:11.080
below $201 level.

01:13:11.081 --> 01:13:12.414
Ethereum is trading much above

01:13:12.415 --> 01:13:14.751
its 20-day exponential moving average.

01:14:08.638 --> 01:14:09.598
Baby?

01:14:12.684 --> 01:14:16.229
I-I had to. He cannot get away with it.

01:14:24.821 --> 01:14:26.573
Baby, is that for here?

01:14:39.294 --> 01:14:40.462
Please...

01:14:41.504 --> 01:14:42.672
Please...

01:15:13.703 --> 01:15:15.038
Have a good night, brother.

01:15:38.895 --> 01:15:40.938
The way you did it is repugnant,

01:15:40.939 --> 01:15:42.898
but tonight's the most you've ever done

01:15:42.899 --> 01:15:44.734
for that girl in your life.

01:15:45.652 --> 01:15:47.904
Whether she sees it or not, I don't know.

01:16:08.049 --> 01:16:09.926
Yeah, this is my fourth message now.

01:16:12.220 --> 01:16:13.763
What you done today...

01:16:14.848 --> 01:16:17.474
no matter what excuse you come up with,

01:16:17.475 --> 01:16:19.268
no matter when you come to your senses,

01:16:19.269 --> 01:16:22.063
you have wrought destruction upon our home,

01:16:22.605 --> 01:16:25.441
and upon me, and on Facebook...

01:16:25.442 --> 01:16:28.277
With words that don't even--

01:16:28.278 --> 01:16:31.572
I-- What are you saying? Your life is a fiction?

01:16:31.573 --> 01:16:33.615
So who then? Who is your abuser?

01:16:33.616 --> 01:16:35.993
Am I? You say the name

01:16:35.994 --> 01:16:38.579
if you call me a liar, your mother a liar.

01:16:38.580 --> 01:16:41.165
With no warning and no honesty.

01:16:41.166 --> 01:16:42.208
Just poison.

01:16:43.668 --> 01:16:44.627
Bitch!

01:17:00.477 --> 01:17:03.021
The name I have now is Louise Cross.

01:17:03.813 --> 01:17:05.732
I was born Louise Bodkin.

01:17:06.608 --> 01:17:08.108
And I am speaking now

01:17:08.109 --> 01:17:11.195
to deny my husband's announcement yesterday,

01:17:11.196 --> 01:17:15.158
which was false, and a falsification of my true life.

01:17:16.326 --> 01:17:19.579
I was abused, but not by Ted Garcia.

01:17:20.622 --> 01:17:23.290
That is a fiction invented by my mother

01:17:23.291 --> 01:17:26.418
and kept alive by her and my husband.

01:17:26.419 --> 01:17:30.047
But it is not my shame, it is my abuser's.

01:17:30.048 --> 01:17:32.425
And he was one of millions.

01:17:32.884 --> 01:17:34.928
I am one of millions.

01:17:35.887 --> 01:17:37.596
We are not a coincidence.

01:17:44.854 --> 01:17:46.981
Hey, Sheriff. You okay?

01:17:47.690 --> 01:17:49.858
Sheriff, we got a noise complaint on the mayor's house.

01:17:49.859 --> 01:17:51.986
I guess he's doing a-a fundraiser.

01:17:52.570 --> 01:17:55.031
Is it too touchy? Do we leave it?

01:17:56.032 --> 01:17:57.283
We do leave it, right?

01:17:58.118 --> 01:17:59.327
Yeah, of course we do.

01:18:45.331 --> 01:18:46.207
Sheriff?

01:18:47.417 --> 01:18:48.959

No, I'll go in your blood. I'll be your poison!

01:22:49.367 --> 01:22:50.910
You put this in me.

01:22:53.204 --> 01:22:58.042
No. I was holding her hand. No.

01:22:59.335 --> 01:23:01.586
It was right after ballet class.

01:23:01.587 --> 01:23:04.424
She said, "Bread pudding, bread pudding."

01:23:04.882 --> 01:23:06.925
I said, "No, baby, no.

01:23:06.926 --> 01:23:09.761
I can't get you dessert. I can't get you dessert."

01:23:09.762 --> 01:23:12.013
Why'd you let go of my hand?

01:23:12.014 --> 01:23:13.890
I was still holding your hand!

01:23:20.815 --> 01:23:22.275
It tastes the same.

01:23:24.694 --> 01:23:26.361
Just tastes the same.

01:23:26.362 --> 01:23:28.823
Wine into water.

01:23:29.615 --> 01:23:31.616
Wine into water, wickedness.

01:23:31.617 --> 01:23:34.035
Wickedness! Wickedness!

01:23:34.036 --> 01:23:35.955
Why?

01:23:37.415 --> 01:23:38.874
You poisoning me?

01:23:38.875 --> 01:23:41.544
I'll poison you! I'll poison you!

01:23:42.712 --> 01:23:45.255
I'll pump in your guts!

01:23:45.256 --> 01:23:46.924
I will pump until you blow up!

01:23:47.341 --> 01:23:48.717
I'll infect your home!

01:23:48.718 --> 01:23:50.927
I'll infect you from the outside.

01:23:52.430 --> 01:23:54.891
You want me dead? You want me dead?

01:23:55.892 --> 01:23:58.102
You want me dead?

01:23:59.103 --> 01:24:00.980
I'll be the death of you!

01:24:02.231 --> 01:24:06.401
You devils! You called this plague!

01:24:06.402 --> 01:24:10.864
You don't want me. You don't care about me.

01:24:12.950 --> 01:24:15.535
Give her back. Give her back.

01:26:18.701 --> 01:26:19.493
Eric?

01:26:21.037 --> 01:26:22.412
Yeah?

01:26:22.413 --> 01:26:24.790
I thought we agreed absolutely no one in the house.

01:26:25.875 --> 01:26:28.294
- Yeah, I know. - So what's this purse?

01:26:30.254 --> 01:26:31.796
What purse?

01:26:31.797 --> 01:26:33.423
Come here and look at what purse.

01:26:33.424 --> 01:26:35.426
You think I didn't see you with that little girl?

01:26:39.722 --> 01:26:41.599
Eric, you should be--

01:26:50.399 --> 01:26:51.108
Dad?

01:29:43.572 --> 01:29:46.116
Hi, you've reached Louise. Leave a message.

01:29:46.117 --> 01:29:48.035
Hey, Rabbit.

01:30:18.732 --> 01:30:19.816
ID?

01:30:19.817 --> 01:30:21.860
I was exposed to somebody a few nights ago,

01:30:21.861 --> 01:30:24.028
and he definitely had it--

01:30:42.173 --> 01:30:43.007
Yeah?

01:31:08.365 --> 01:31:09.450
Sheriff.

01:31:11.619 --> 01:31:13.120
You need to be ready.

01:31:14.163 --> 01:31:15.915
It's really bad.

01:31:17.541 --> 01:31:19.960
But I think you might be Mayor now.

01:31:22.087 --> 01:31:23.547
Who-Who's that?

01:31:24.298 --> 01:31:27.717
Oh. He's new. I think that's the next door property.

01:31:27.718 --> 01:31:30.386
Is that Brian? His friend?

01:31:30.387 --> 01:31:31.597
Whose friend?

01:31:34.183 --> 01:31:35.768
Yeah, must be a neighbor.

01:31:37.102 --> 01:31:38.646
And--

01:31:41.899 --> 01:31:43.524
Well, hi, Tam.

01:31:43.525 --> 01:31:44.901
She found the body.

01:31:44.902 --> 01:31:45.694
Hey, Sheriff.

01:31:47.321 --> 01:31:48.905
You found it?

01:31:48.906 --> 01:31:52.367
Yeah, I did, Sheriff. I-I called you as soon as I could.

01:31:52.368 --> 01:31:54.702
I didn't go in, but Sammy broke off from my walk,

01:31:54.703 --> 01:31:56.246
and he went in,

01:31:56.247 --> 01:31:58.456
and I tried to get him back as soon as I could,

01:31:58.457 --> 01:32:01.084
but he was in there and I think he was licking things.

01:32:01.085 --> 01:32:02.460
And I tried to get him back, and...

01:32:02.461 --> 01:32:03.544
Okay.

01:32:03.545 --> 01:32:05.839
- I called you. I'm sorry. - What is that?

01:32:06.423 --> 01:32:07.715
Yeah, she called them, too.

01:32:07.716 --> 01:32:10.009
Well, just in case they needed to see. I--

01:32:10.010 --> 01:32:11.052
See what?

01:32:12.721 --> 01:32:13.846
They have been waiting outside.

01:32:13.847 --> 01:32:15.556
I guess this is the Pueblo border.

01:32:15.557 --> 01:32:18.101
No, this is not. Negative.

01:32:18.102 --> 01:32:20.688
- I think it is, though. - It is.

01:32:21.563 --> 01:32:23.439
We're on the county line. This is Sevilla County.

01:32:23.440 --> 01:32:25.066
But on the other side of the house, that's Pueblo.

01:32:25.067 --> 01:32:26.360
It's the same at mine.

01:32:40.541 --> 01:32:41.833
Oh.

01:32:41.834 --> 01:32:43.209
Is that Butterfly?

01:32:43.210 --> 01:32:45.253
Yeah, Detective Butterballs.

01:32:45.254 --> 01:32:47.630
And that's the Pueblo Sheriff down here.

01:32:47.631 --> 01:32:48.965
Pueblos don't have sheriffs.

01:32:48.966 --> 01:32:50.508
He's not even police.

01:32:50.509 --> 01:32:52.427
But he goes around and blesses shit.

01:32:52.428 --> 01:32:54.679
Apparently he's in charge of all Pueblo matters.

01:32:54.680 --> 01:32:56.180
This is not a Pueblo matter.

01:32:56.181 --> 01:32:57.849
- I know. - We are Eddington.

01:32:57.850 --> 01:32:59.476
This is Eddington.

01:33:16.452 --> 01:33:18.162
Well, what the hell is that?

01:33:19.038 --> 01:33:20.998
There's been more lootings in town, too.

01:33:21.498 --> 01:33:23.124
Shops all smashed up.

01:33:23.125 --> 01:33:24.667
That's BLM talk.

01:33:24.668 --> 01:33:26.586
You've secured the search warrant, right?

01:33:26.587 --> 01:33:28.504
I did. It has been signed.

01:33:28.505 --> 01:33:29.631
I got a runner bringing it down.

01:33:30.591 --> 01:33:34.427
Mm-hmm. And, uh, what about OMI?

01:33:34.428 --> 01:33:36.220
I didn't want to call them until you got here.

01:33:36.221 --> 01:33:37.848
I called them. They're on their way.

01:33:38.974 --> 01:33:40.266
Needle in a haystack, but I found

01:33:40.267 --> 01:33:41.977
a single five-five-six casing.

01:33:43.479 --> 01:33:45.480
Uh, okay.

01:33:45.481 --> 01:33:46.981
Well, what--

01:33:46.982 --> 01:33:48.692
Just put it right there on the counter.

01:33:49.818 --> 01:33:51.945
Uh, how-- how many impacts you count?

01:33:53.238 --> 01:33:54.573
Well, don't worry about it.

01:33:56.533 --> 01:33:59.702
I-I also found good quality tire tracks back there.

01:33:59.703 --> 01:34:01.330
Truck or SUV.

01:34:02.289 --> 01:34:03.623
What are you even doing here?

01:34:03.624 --> 01:34:05.958
This is our crime scene, and you are contaminating it.

01:34:05.959 --> 01:34:07.336
Now get out of here!

01:34:11.840 --> 01:34:17.178
Okay, let's focus. DRT here. DRT there.

01:34:17.179 --> 01:34:19.222
Sheriff, I tried to get some CCTV footage.

01:34:19.223 --> 01:34:20.640
Hard-drive got took.

01:34:20.641 --> 01:34:22.934
Bless you.

01:34:22.935 --> 01:34:24.811
That's for a handwriting expert.

01:34:24.812 --> 01:34:26.062
Look-- Look at those "E"s.

01:34:26.063 --> 01:34:27.522
Uh-huh. Okay,

01:34:27.523 --> 01:34:29.690
but, well, look at this. Now what is this? A ladies purse?

01:34:29.691 --> 01:34:31.567
- Guy, would you come help? - Yup.

01:34:31.568 --> 01:34:32.736
This here...

01:34:35.697 --> 01:34:37.698
Whoa, whoa. What are you doing?

01:34:37.699 --> 01:34:38.826
Forensics.

01:34:39.868 --> 01:34:40.786
Ah, shit.

01:34:42.121 --> 01:34:45.039
Well, it's compromised, it's too late. Go ahead.

01:34:45.040 --> 01:34:46.374
I'm getting to be really happy

01:34:46.375 --> 01:34:47.542
you guys don't help us with jack shit.

01:34:47.543 --> 01:34:49.210
Oh, but now you want to help us.

01:34:49.211 --> 01:34:50.711
With all your resources?

01:34:50.712 --> 01:34:51.879
Same resources as you.

01:34:51.880 --> 01:34:53.714
- More technology, more people. - Sarah Allen.

01:34:53.715 --> 01:34:55.216
- We've got gloves. - Born 2001.

01:34:55.217 --> 01:34:56.259
That's the girl that was shrieking

01:34:56.260 --> 01:34:57.261
at you during the riot.

01:34:58.387 --> 01:34:59.887
Look, she's got the Blacks Lives Matters pin.

01:34:59.888 --> 01:35:02.181
All of this is getting thrown out now.

01:35:02.182 --> 01:35:03.599
You understand that?

01:35:03.600 --> 01:35:05.560
Unless you find a judge even stupider than this one.

01:35:05.561 --> 01:35:07.103
Hey, don't you have some sort of alcoholic domestic

01:35:07.104 --> 01:35:08.563
at one of your casinos?

01:35:08.564 --> 01:35:09.939
This ain't yours, man.

01:35:09.940 --> 01:35:12.525
The shooter's on tribal ground. This is a Pueblo case.

01:35:12.526 --> 01:35:15.236
Give me your evidence and get on down the road.

01:35:15.237 --> 01:35:16.779
Victim was here, okay?

01:35:16.780 --> 01:35:18.448
This is where the harm was committed.

01:35:18.449 --> 01:35:19.532
This is our case.

01:35:19.533 --> 01:35:21.075
Well, we got the shell casing.

01:35:21.076 --> 01:35:22.118
Congratulations!

01:35:22.119 --> 01:35:23.995
Do what you want with the shell casings.

01:35:23.996 --> 01:35:25.456
There is no cross commission here.

01:35:25.873 --> 01:35:28.040
We respect your sovereignty. Respect ours now.

01:35:28.041 --> 01:35:29.208
Oh, you respect our sovereignty?

01:35:29.209 --> 01:35:31.252
Okay, let's call the Feds and the BIA

01:35:31.253 --> 01:35:32.754
and see what they want to do. Easy.

01:35:33.755 --> 01:35:36.424
Okay. Uh... Let's, um,

01:35:36.425 --> 01:35:38.092
go talk to this Sarah Allen because I...

01:35:38.093 --> 01:35:40.136
All right. Well, we're going to take it from here.

01:35:40.137 --> 01:35:41.596
Don't let him dink with the crime scene.

01:35:41.597 --> 01:35:44.098
What crime scene? It's your toilet now.

01:35:44.099 --> 01:35:47.810
Officer Jimenez, can you please leave the property?

01:35:47.811 --> 01:35:49.228
Watch how you approach me.

01:35:49.229 --> 01:35:51.731
Okay, so you were there with your boyfriend...

01:35:51.732 --> 01:35:53.941
He's-- He's not my boy-- He wasn't my boyfriend.

01:35:53.942 --> 01:35:56.277
- I barely even knew him. - Okay, you're in his house--

01:35:56.278 --> 01:35:58.529
- I was hardly there. - You were in his house.

01:35:58.530 --> 01:36:01.824
And then later that night, he's dead, his dad is dead.

01:36:01.825 --> 01:36:05.036
Are they-- Are they really dead? Like how do you know?

01:36:05.037 --> 01:36:07.748
Yeah, well, we were there. They are deceased.

01:36:08.165 --> 01:36:10.917
And, um-- And your purse is there.

01:36:10.918 --> 01:36:12.460
Sarah, we went through your socials.

01:36:12.461 --> 01:36:14.128
You didn't do yourself any-all favors.

01:36:14.129 --> 01:36:15.129
I'm not trying to--

01:36:15.130 --> 01:36:16.757
For example, here's a quote, from you.

01:36:17.341 --> 01:36:20.092
Uh, "Free your communities, arm yourselves--"

01:36:20.093 --> 01:36:21.802
No, that's completely taken out of--

01:36:21.803 --> 01:36:23.846
I don't-- I don't mean literal arms. That's not--

01:36:23.847 --> 01:36:25.473
It's preaching rioting and looting.

01:36:25.474 --> 01:36:27.517
Do you know, being an accessory to terrorism...

01:36:27.518 --> 01:36:28.684
I'm not a part of any terrorism.

01:36:28.685 --> 01:36:30.186
...is terrorism.

01:36:30.187 --> 01:36:32.772
That doesn't make-- The looters and rioters, they are separate!

01:36:32.773 --> 01:36:35.358
I'm not any part of that, and none of the protesters are.

01:36:35.359 --> 01:36:37.777
The rioters, they're being planted by the Right.

01:36:37.778 --> 01:36:39.278
They're trying to make it look like it's the protesters

01:36:39.279 --> 01:36:41.364
so that scared old white people won't complain

01:36:41.365 --> 01:36:42.865
when Martial law happens!

01:36:46.453 --> 01:36:48.871
Uh, good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.

01:36:48.872 --> 01:36:52.458
My name is Joe Cross. Joseph Cross.

01:36:52.459 --> 01:36:54.086
Sheriff of Sevilla County.

01:36:54.920 --> 01:36:58.422
Last night around midnight,

01:36:58.423 --> 01:37:02.635
Mayor Ted Garcia and his son, Eric Garcia,

01:37:02.636 --> 01:37:06.556
were struck down by cowardly sniper fire.

01:37:06.557 --> 01:37:09.725
Now, I do believe we have sufficient evidence

01:37:09.726 --> 01:37:14.188
to believe that the perpetrator was a member-- or members--

01:37:14.189 --> 01:37:17.442
of the Antifa terrorist group,

01:37:18.151 --> 01:37:20.611
capitalizing on the recent tragic events

01:37:20.612 --> 01:37:22.573
in Minneapolis to sow chaos.

01:37:23.073 --> 01:37:25.742
Now, to the criminals that committed this act:

01:37:26.451 --> 01:37:28.244
you will soon find out

01:37:28.245 --> 01:37:31.414
what justice looks like in Sevilla County.

01:37:31.415 --> 01:37:34.543
You will find out. It will not be tolerated.

01:37:35.419 --> 01:37:38.754
And now a personal message to the individuals

01:37:38.755 --> 01:37:41.340
planning to take their criminal conduct

01:37:41.341 --> 01:37:43.635
out of the streets and into the neighborhoods.

01:37:44.094 --> 01:37:45.886
I would tell them:

01:37:45.887 --> 01:37:50.350
if you value your life, you should think twice,

01:37:50.976 --> 01:37:54.437
because the people of Eddington like guns.

01:37:54.438 --> 01:37:57.732
And I encourage them to own guns,

01:37:57.733 --> 01:38:00.109
and they're going to be in their homes tonight

01:38:00.110 --> 01:38:02.362
with their guns loaded.

01:38:02.863 --> 01:38:06.574
And if you try to break into their homes to steal,

01:38:06.575 --> 01:38:11.287
to set fire, to commit physical injury and/or death,

01:38:11.288 --> 01:38:13.456
then I'm highly recommending

01:38:13.457 --> 01:38:15.499
that they blow you out of their homes

01:38:15.500 --> 01:38:17.169
with their guns.

01:38:19.046 --> 01:38:20.254
Eddington, New Mexico,

01:38:20.255 --> 01:38:21.922
despite its meager population,

01:38:21.923 --> 01:38:25.092
is quickly being co-opted in online circles

01:38:25.093 --> 01:38:27.553
as a poster town for anti-government,

01:38:27.554 --> 01:38:29.305
anti-police violence.

01:38:29.306 --> 01:38:32.642
Meanwhile, Albuquerque's new public safety department,

01:38:32.643 --> 01:38:35.603
designed to relieve stress on the city's police,

01:38:35.604 --> 01:38:37.605
will deploy unarmed personnel

01:38:37.606 --> 01:38:39.273
made up of social workers,

01:38:39.274 --> 01:38:41.359
housing and homelessness specialists

01:38:41.360 --> 01:38:44.154
and violence prevention coordinators...

01:39:41.795 --> 01:39:43.421
Ooh.

01:39:43.422 --> 01:39:44.464
Thank you.

01:39:52.097 --> 01:39:54.474
I had to post a whole statement against her video.

01:39:56.184 --> 01:39:57.936
And her phone's not ringing.

01:40:01.189 --> 01:40:03.275
Vernon blocked me.

01:40:05.485 --> 01:40:08.113
Can you try her again and see if it rings for you?

01:40:10.532 --> 01:40:12.492
I've been trying.

01:40:13.243 --> 01:40:14.536
It's not working.

01:40:15.203 --> 01:40:17.289
So what does that mean? Did she block you?

01:40:19.833 --> 01:40:21.668
Did something happen to her?

01:40:25.922 --> 01:40:27.340
Did you pay the phone?

01:40:32.971 --> 01:40:34.681
So she did? She blocked us?

01:40:42.647 --> 01:40:46.233
How did she meet Vernon? Did you introduce her?

01:40:46.234 --> 01:40:48.235
All I did was I-I

01:40:48.236 --> 01:40:51.155
encouraged her to do her own research.

01:40:51.156 --> 01:40:54.867
And she was mad at you, so I took her to Albuquerque

01:40:54.868 --> 01:40:56.952
because he was there to do that talk. That lecture.

01:40:56.953 --> 01:40:59.164
I didn't like some of the things he was saying, but...

01:41:00.373 --> 01:41:04.043
I was so relieved that she was getting involved,

01:41:04.044 --> 01:41:06.962
and I thought her head was coming out of the sand and...

01:41:53.218 --> 01:41:56.011
I actually ain't leaving until something is done.

01:41:56.012 --> 01:41:57.430
Yeah. Um...

01:41:57.973 --> 01:42:01.559
Sheriff. The kid says he'll only talk to you.

01:42:03.019 --> 01:42:04.854
He's been avoiding eye contact like he's on something.

01:42:04.855 --> 01:42:06.356
I saw him at the riots.

01:42:14.197 --> 01:42:15.948
The next morning,

01:42:15.949 --> 01:42:17.825
after I sent the picture to,

01:42:17.826 --> 01:42:19.369
uh, him, out there...

01:42:19.703 --> 01:42:21.037
To-- To Michael.

01:42:21.746 --> 01:42:23.206
- Yeah, Michael. - Okay.

01:42:24.833 --> 01:42:26.000
The next morning,

01:42:26.001 --> 01:42:28.628
I-I went to Eric's to see if...

01:42:29.462 --> 01:42:30.755
You know, if...

01:42:31.631 --> 01:42:33.299
See if that girl was still there,

01:42:33.300 --> 01:42:35.218
if she slept over or whatever.

01:42:35.927 --> 01:42:36.760
Sarah.

01:42:36.761 --> 01:42:37.387
Yeah.

01:42:38.263 --> 01:42:39.263
Uh,

01:42:39.264 --> 01:42:42.017
but that's when I saw police cars.

01:42:42.809 --> 01:42:43.934
Okay.

01:42:43.935 --> 01:42:44.811
Um...

01:42:45.562 --> 01:42:46.770
Uh...

01:42:46.771 --> 01:42:50.232
Yeah, you just sit-- sit tight, okay?

01:42:50.233 --> 01:42:53.862
And, uh...

01:42:59.492 --> 01:43:02.203
Hey, Guy, get in there. I got to go grab my phone.

01:43:09.210 --> 01:43:11.129
Hey! You need any help?

01:43:13.882 --> 01:43:15.215
Do you know-- Do you know Michael?

01:43:15.216 --> 01:43:16.468
No, no, no.

01:43:16.885 --> 01:43:20.013
I did see him talking to Sarah at a protest, and...

01:43:20.972 --> 01:43:22.264
I mean, he...

01:43:22.265 --> 01:43:24.935
He looked like he could kill somebody.

01:43:25.477 --> 01:43:26.727
Like he--

01:43:26.728 --> 01:43:28.062
But obviously I didn't actually think that.

01:43:28.063 --> 01:43:29.521
We gotta get to his place, like, now.

01:43:29.522 --> 01:43:31.065
Before he can flush anything.

01:43:31.066 --> 01:43:32.441
Look, can I leave?

01:43:32.442 --> 01:43:33.901
Can you not do anything with me here?

01:43:33.902 --> 01:43:35.403
You can step outside, Brian.

01:43:46.748 --> 01:43:48.123
He's ambitious.

01:43:48.124 --> 01:43:50.292
He's been cozying up to you, you know. Getting real close.

01:43:50.293 --> 01:43:52.544
Maybe he kills the mayor,

01:43:52.545 --> 01:43:54.755
then you win, and you help him get sheriff.

01:43:54.756 --> 01:43:56.090
I don't know.

01:43:56.091 --> 01:43:58.760
Uh-- Maybe he's been spying this whole time.

01:43:59.135 --> 01:44:00.636
What whole time?

01:44:00.637 --> 01:44:02.347
I mean, his dad was here first.

01:44:02.931 --> 01:44:04.349
Yeah, exactly.

01:44:05.308 --> 01:44:08.061
I'm not trying to make this about...

01:44:08.478 --> 01:44:11.271
I didn't even see the race with Michael,

01:44:11.272 --> 01:44:13.649
until all this Blacks Lives Matter stuff.

01:44:13.650 --> 01:44:17.069
But now here it is. Okay? So-- So who is he now?

01:44:17.070 --> 01:44:19.864
Is he more of an officer or more...?

01:44:22.617 --> 01:44:24.285
But we need evidence.

01:44:24.828 --> 01:44:27.789
I mean, that's just motive. I mean, I have motive.

01:44:28.540 --> 01:44:30.791
You know, and Eric wasn't white, he's Hispanic.

01:44:30.792 --> 01:44:33.670
Yeah. Blacks hate Hispanics, too.

01:44:34.129 --> 01:44:36.463
All these other colors are just fake minorities

01:44:36.464 --> 01:44:37.798
stealing their coupons away.

01:44:37.799 --> 01:44:39.884
They hate them more than they hate whites.

01:44:41.928 --> 01:44:42.929
Okay, Mike.

01:44:44.389 --> 01:44:47.599
Just... There were some allegations made.

01:44:47.600 --> 01:44:50.811
And, uh, we need to specifically look at your Instagram.

01:44:50.812 --> 01:44:52.938
Just so we can clear you. Okay?

01:44:52.939 --> 01:44:54.815
Allegations like-- like what?

01:44:54.816 --> 01:44:56.150
We just need to take a look

01:44:56.151 --> 01:44:59.111
at your Instagram messages, specifically.

01:44:59.112 --> 01:45:01.990
And, uh, that's it. We'll be done with this.

01:45:05.744 --> 01:45:08.538
It's okay. All right, come on.

01:45:14.961 --> 01:45:15.836
So--

01:45:15.837 --> 01:45:16.879
Wait, wait, wait.

01:45:16.880 --> 01:45:19.006
I'm just documenting that

01:45:19.007 --> 01:45:21.133
this message has been opened, as you can see.

01:45:21.134 --> 01:45:23.343
Okay. And, uh,

01:45:23.344 --> 01:45:26.014
hmm...

01:45:32.145 --> 01:45:32.937
What?

01:45:33.354 --> 01:45:35.231
Yeah. I know. Eric Garcia, right?

01:45:35.648 --> 01:45:38.485
Mikey, well, it's Eric Garcia and...

01:45:39.027 --> 01:45:42.154
with this young lady that you have a connection to...

01:45:42.155 --> 01:45:43.447
Connection? Hardly a connection.

01:45:43.448 --> 01:45:44.574
I hardly know her.

01:45:46.242 --> 01:45:47.577
Does that say something?

01:45:49.245 --> 01:45:52.039
I mean, it is the day before he got fucking shot, Mike.

01:45:52.040 --> 01:45:53.832
And he's taking pictures with your little girlfriend.

01:45:53.833 --> 01:45:55.375
Tooley, I swear to God, man.

01:45:55.376 --> 01:45:56.210
Okay.

01:45:56.211 --> 01:45:56.878
Hey.

01:45:58.755 --> 01:46:01.674
Mike, how old's this girl?

01:46:02.509 --> 01:46:04.551
I don't know. Like 18.

01:46:04.552 --> 01:46:06.637
Like 18? So not 18?

01:46:06.638 --> 01:46:09.598
She's definitely 18. Is that what the allegation is?

01:46:09.599 --> 01:46:10.724
Mikey--

01:46:10.725 --> 01:46:12.810
Sheriff, my point is, I hardly know her.

01:46:12.811 --> 01:46:14.269
And we haven't done anything.

01:46:14.270 --> 01:46:15.729
All right, look, it didn't bother you

01:46:15.730 --> 01:46:16.855
when you got this photo?

01:46:16.856 --> 01:46:18.524
It doesn't bother you to see her like that?

01:46:18.525 --> 01:46:20.943
No. I mean, the only reason that bothers me

01:46:20.944 --> 01:46:22.945
is because someone was trying to bother me.

01:46:22.946 --> 01:46:24.780
But then I completely forgot about it, Sheriff.

01:46:24.781 --> 01:46:25.573
Sheriff?

01:46:25.949 --> 01:46:27.157
Yeah.

01:46:27.158 --> 01:46:29.243
Could you, uh, step outside, please?

01:46:29.244 --> 01:46:31.662
Can I step inside, please?

01:46:31.663 --> 01:46:33.164
We got a 10-80 in the back seat.

01:46:41.089 --> 01:46:44.259
Now, why wasn't this checked in immediately?

01:46:44.717 --> 01:46:46.301
Checked in?

01:46:46.302 --> 01:46:48.346
I would've checked it in by the end of the day.

01:46:49.514 --> 01:46:51.807
Sheriff, you knew I had the gun out for practice.

01:46:51.808 --> 01:46:52.933
You're the one that told me to practice.

01:46:52.934 --> 01:46:54.351
It's just a coincidence, right?

01:46:54.352 --> 01:46:56.146
That it's just the same caliber as the murder weapon?

01:46:56.813 --> 01:46:58.397
Sh-- Sheriff, you can give this to ballistics,

01:46:58.398 --> 01:47:00.900
and you will see it's not the same gun. Simple.

01:47:03.319 --> 01:47:05.112
Okay, we got to search the unit.

01:47:05.113 --> 01:47:06.530
I mean, what for? We already established

01:47:06.531 --> 01:47:07.531
the gun's in the back of the car.

01:47:07.532 --> 01:47:08.782
You know what for.

01:47:08.783 --> 01:47:10.492
- Okay? Is that all right? - What?

01:47:10.493 --> 01:47:11.743
You don't need my permission to search my unit.

01:47:11.744 --> 01:47:12.953
I know I don't need your permission.

01:47:12.954 --> 01:47:14.204
I'm just asking you.

01:47:14.205 --> 01:47:16.290
And I got nothing to hide, so we can proceed.

01:47:16.291 --> 01:47:17.416
Good, good. Come on.

01:47:17.417 --> 01:47:18.876
Let's give him a little bit of space.

01:47:18.877 --> 01:47:19.918
Who? Excuse me.

01:47:19.919 --> 01:47:21.795
I don't give my permission to him.

01:47:21.796 --> 01:47:22.796
Hell fucking no.

01:47:22.797 --> 01:47:23.839
I don't care if you give him permission.

01:47:23.840 --> 01:47:24.631
No, but I don't trust him.

01:47:24.632 --> 01:47:26.092
I don't care if you trust him.

01:47:27.135 --> 01:47:28.302
Okay, fine, why don't we just get

01:47:28.303 --> 01:47:29.511
our Pueblo friend to do it?

01:47:29.512 --> 01:47:31.013
Since you're just-- everywhere!

01:47:31.014 --> 01:47:33.725
You know, third party, no conflict.

01:47:34.058 --> 01:47:34.809
Okay?

01:47:37.228 --> 01:47:38.646
- Fine. - Yeah?

01:47:39.147 --> 01:47:39.981
Yeah.

01:47:40.481 --> 01:47:41.774
Hey, you have gloves?

01:48:00.001 --> 01:48:01.085
Got a bag.

01:48:17.018 --> 01:48:17.936
Got something.

01:48:20.647 --> 01:48:23.441
What-- What's that? What the fuck is that?

01:48:23.858 --> 01:48:25.400
I've never seen that before.

01:48:25.401 --> 01:48:27.194
"To a marvelous mayor."

01:48:27.195 --> 01:48:29.029
- It says that? - This is his fucking watch.

01:48:29.030 --> 01:48:30.030
- Sheriff. - Excuse me.

01:48:30.031 --> 01:48:31.031
What the fuck?

01:48:31.032 --> 01:48:32.491
That wasn't there-- What do you mean?

01:48:32.492 --> 01:48:33.909
Do I have permission to arrest him?

01:48:33.910 --> 01:48:35.744
- Can you believe...? - Hands up, Mike.

01:48:35.745 --> 01:48:37.704
- This doesn't even feel real. - Come on, Mike. Hands up.

01:48:37.705 --> 01:48:39.539
- Don't go near your weapon. - Hands up for what?

01:48:39.540 --> 01:48:41.083
- Okay. - Sheriff, here's his weapon.

01:48:41.084 --> 01:48:42.334
He's been disarmed.

01:48:42.335 --> 01:48:43.335
What is going on right now? I can't--

01:48:43.336 --> 01:48:45.963
I've never seen that watch before.

01:48:45.964 --> 01:48:47.214
- Hands, Mike! - It's impossible.

01:48:47.215 --> 01:48:49.216
Hey, easy! Take it easy!

01:48:49.217 --> 01:48:51.843
All right, step inside the cell please, Sergeant.

01:48:57.892 --> 01:49:00.018
Hey, Guy. Put this into evidence and send the gun

01:49:00.019 --> 01:49:02.396
- out to the lab, okay? - Hey, Sheriff.

01:49:02.397 --> 01:49:03.730
Sheriff, if I'm really being arrested,

01:49:03.731 --> 01:49:05.358
I need to make my phone call. Please.

01:49:06.567 --> 01:49:07.360
All right.

01:49:21.541 --> 01:49:24.294
Sheriff, please. Please don't do this to me. I'm--

01:49:24.752 --> 01:49:25.878
Hey.

01:49:27.880 --> 01:49:29.257
I haven't done anything wrong.

01:49:45.440 --> 01:49:49.235
Uncle Jamie, uh, it's me, Michael.

01:49:51.404 --> 01:49:53.113
I'm in the hol-- holding cell

01:49:53.114 --> 01:49:54.615
at the Sheriff's Office in Eddington.

01:49:58.494 --> 01:50:03.416
I-I've just been arrested, and I'm being set up.

01:50:06.419 --> 01:50:07.836
They're planting shit on me,

01:50:07.837 --> 01:50:09.671
and they're saying that I killed...

01:50:09.672 --> 01:50:14.134
...I killed the mayor and-- and his son, and-- and I didn't.

01:50:16.888 --> 01:50:19.015
I'm gonna need some help.

01:50:19.766 --> 01:50:21.392
I'm gonna need a lawyer...

01:50:29.567 --> 01:50:31.152
I love you and Aunt Kyra.

01:51:04.143 --> 01:51:05.852
The meaning of a candlelight vigil

01:51:05.853 --> 01:51:07.521
is different for everyone.

01:51:07.522 --> 01:51:09.439
Candles get lit one by one.

01:51:09.440 --> 01:51:12.067
It's a symbol for spreading a message of support

01:51:12.068 --> 01:51:14.236
from one person to another.

01:51:14.237 --> 01:51:15.695
As darkness surrounds us,

01:51:15.696 --> 01:51:18.198
a good man and a bright young boy

01:51:18.199 --> 01:51:20.618
struck down before they could do their work

01:51:21.244 --> 01:51:23.538
towards real progress in this town.

01:51:24.622 --> 01:51:26.540
Progress towards a better, more equitable,

01:51:26.541 --> 01:51:28.126
more connected future.

01:51:28.918 --> 01:51:30.210
Work that will still be done,

01:51:30.211 --> 01:51:31.878
and we'll see to it that it is done...

01:51:31.879 --> 01:51:33.756
in their memory and their honor.

01:52:42.992 --> 01:52:45.578
Hello? Help!

01:52:47.663 --> 01:52:48.998
Hello?

01:52:52.335 --> 01:52:55.712
Pueblo Police.

01:53:04.472 --> 01:53:06.014
My daughter went off with a man...

01:53:06.015 --> 01:53:07.182
- I'm sorry. - ...and I think that they

01:53:07.183 --> 01:53:09.267
or she, or he were just here

01:53:09.268 --> 01:53:10.519
because when I came back,

01:53:10.520 --> 01:53:12.020
- all her stuff was gone... - Ma'am.

01:53:12.021 --> 01:53:13.772
...all her artwork and the car and everything.

01:53:13.773 --> 01:53:16.149
I'm just here to ask you if there's a gun in the house.

01:53:16.150 --> 01:53:17.526
- Sheriff. - They took everything.

01:53:17.527 --> 01:53:19.027
Sheriff, are you there, Sheriff?

01:53:19.028 --> 01:53:20.529
Yeah, but have you seen this AR in the house?

01:53:20.530 --> 01:53:22.155
I have no idea.

01:53:22.156 --> 01:53:23.865
Do you think he could have done the murders?

01:53:23.866 --> 01:53:26.284
His name is Vernon Peak.

01:53:28.663 --> 01:53:29.996
Yeah?

01:53:29.997 --> 01:53:31.707
Sheriff, we got a dumpster fire in the back.

01:53:32.500 --> 01:53:34.459
He was a person of color

01:53:34.460 --> 01:53:37.296
who beat the odds to become a person of power.

01:53:38.506 --> 01:53:41.968
And they got killed by that same system.

01:53:42.927 --> 01:53:44.971
Even the killer's a victim of it.

01:53:45.513 --> 01:53:47.098
And I'm a part of it.

01:53:47.515 --> 01:53:49.349
I'm just another privileged white kid...

01:53:50.476 --> 01:53:53.353
...and my job is to sit down and listen,

01:53:53.354 --> 01:53:55.564
which is what I plan to do after making this speech,

01:53:55.565 --> 01:53:58.943
which I have no right to make!

01:54:00.361 --> 01:54:03.488
This vigil is happening on stolen ground!

01:54:17.378 --> 01:54:21.172
I was putting the stupid watch and gun into evidence.

01:54:21.173 --> 01:54:23.217
Oh, the watch and gun are stupid?

01:54:24.385 --> 01:54:25.885
I swear on God, Sheriff.

01:54:25.886 --> 01:54:27.721
I wasn't gone for more than one minute.

01:54:27.722 --> 01:54:29.599
You weren't supposed to be gone at all!

01:54:33.477 --> 01:54:35.353
Shit. Where the fuck is the fire extinguisher?

01:54:35.354 --> 01:54:37.106
I already used it. It wasn't enough.

01:54:38.024 --> 01:54:39.107
- I know. I know... - What?

01:54:39.108 --> 01:54:40.400
I know, I know, I know. - What?

01:54:40.401 --> 01:54:41.610
Th-- This is the new thing.

01:54:41.611 --> 01:54:43.612
This happened after I called you.

01:54:43.613 --> 01:54:45.948
What the fuck am I looking at?

01:54:53.456 --> 01:54:54.998
Whose fucking key is this?

01:54:54.999 --> 01:54:56.374
- This your key? - I don't know. No!

01:54:56.375 --> 01:54:58.460
- No? Then why did you open it? - No!

01:54:58.461 --> 01:54:59.586
What you're seeing is what I saw.

01:54:59.587 --> 01:55:01.129
What do you mean? What am I seeing?

01:55:01.130 --> 01:55:02.088
I don't even know what the fuck I'm seeing!

01:55:02.089 --> 01:55:03.089
You are how I was.

01:55:03.090 --> 01:55:04.341
You're not making any fucking sense!

01:55:04.342 --> 01:55:06.051
Somebody had to let him out, right?

01:55:06.052 --> 01:55:07.636
You take Zia, I'll take Main!

01:57:07.715 --> 01:57:08.924
Hands, Mike!

01:57:09.425 --> 01:57:11.259
Put your hands behind your head.

01:57:11.260 --> 01:57:12.970
Put your hands behind your head, Mike.

01:57:13.679 --> 01:57:15.556
Turn around and walk backwards towards me.

01:57:17.266 --> 01:57:19.101
Down on the ground, Mike! Down!

01:57:19.518 --> 01:57:21.144
Now! Get down on the ground!

01:57:21.145 --> 01:57:23.104
What the fuck are you doing, Mike?

01:57:23.105 --> 01:57:25.231
Sheriff, he won't listen to me.

01:57:25.232 --> 01:57:27.651
He's just standing there. I don't know what's going on.

01:57:28.068 --> 01:57:29.737
Mike, what the fuck, man?

01:57:30.571 --> 01:57:31.489
Mike.

01:57:32.114 --> 01:57:34.073
The whole place smells like gas.

01:57:36.118 --> 01:57:39.371
What the fuck? Mike, please, man!

01:57:39.955 --> 01:57:41.707
What is this, Mike?

01:57:43.083 --> 01:57:46.002
Mike! Put your hands behind your head!

01:57:46.003 --> 01:57:47.545
I can't. I can't.

01:57:47.546 --> 01:57:50.256
What are you saying?

01:57:50.257 --> 01:57:52.759
What the fuck is going on here?

01:57:52.760 --> 01:57:54.385
Put your hands behind your fucking head, Mike.

01:57:54.386 --> 01:57:56.429
They said if I talk or move,

01:57:56.430 --> 01:57:57.806
they're gonna shoot me.

01:57:57.807 --> 01:57:59.307
I don't--

01:57:59.308 --> 01:58:01.268
What do we do? Should we advance?

01:58:01.727 --> 01:58:03.311
Do we fall back? Can we fall back?

01:58:04.522 --> 01:58:06.064
This feels really not good, Sheriff.

01:58:06.065 --> 01:58:08.775
I've got cover! Go, hands on!

01:58:10.820 --> 01:58:13.989
No. No, no, no! No. Stop!

02:03:05.072 --> 02:03:06.406
Freeze!

02:03:07.282 --> 02:03:10.369
Put the bag down.

02:03:19.253 --> 02:03:20.295
Rabbit?

02:03:33.976 --> 02:03:35.561
I knew you'd come back.

02:03:39.898 --> 02:03:42.234
It's because of what I did, isn't it?

02:03:43.944 --> 02:03:46.280
I'm being called upon, aren't I?

02:03:47.281 --> 02:03:48.740
Am I being called upon?

02:03:51.743 --> 02:03:54.246
They're-They're coming after me.

02:04:01.420 --> 02:04:03.754
Is what I'm supposed to do--

02:04:03.755 --> 02:04:06.132
Is this... Am I supposed to...

02:04:06.133 --> 02:04:08.676
Do you want me to finish this?

02:04:08.677 --> 02:04:09.636
So...

02:04:12.514 --> 02:04:15.726
it was Vernon. And Lou.

02:04:17.978 --> 02:04:20.814
I need to leave. I cannot be here.

02:04:23.275 --> 02:04:25.110
What if they're back for us?

02:04:26.069 --> 02:04:29.990
If they did kill Ted... What if they're back to kill me?

02:04:31.825 --> 02:04:33.410
I killed Ted.

02:04:34.536 --> 02:04:35.579
I did it.

02:04:39.666 --> 02:04:41.960
Vernon-- Vernon is a fake.

02:04:42.794 --> 02:04:44.962
He was a false temptation,

02:04:44.963 --> 02:04:49.468
and she let herself get tricked, and she went with him.

02:04:51.220 --> 02:04:54.973
I'm the one that's taken action.

02:04:55.557 --> 02:04:59.936
All I had to do was start it. And now I have to finish it.

02:04:59.937 --> 02:05:03.147
We are in the center of it right now.

02:05:03.148 --> 02:05:04.941
We are in history.

02:05:18.080 --> 02:05:19.163
See?

02:05:34.012 --> 02:05:35.973
Get down!

02:05:37.724 --> 02:05:38.975
My back!

02:05:38.976 --> 02:05:41.602
No! Is it them? It's them!

02:05:41.603 --> 02:05:43.479
Is it them?

02:05:43.480 --> 02:05:45.774
It's Vernon, they're trying to kill me!

02:10:11.831 --> 02:10:12.832
Freeze!

02:13:43.918 --> 02:13:45.586
I'm going to shoot! I'm going to shoot!

02:14:07.400 --> 02:14:09.736
Oh, my God. Oh, my God, Sheriff.

02:14:10.278 --> 02:14:12.613
Oh, my God, are you okay? Sheriff?

02:14:12.614 --> 02:14:14.531
Sheriff, I saved you.

02:14:14.532 --> 02:14:15.742
I saved you.

02:14:18.495 --> 02:14:21.790
Oh. Oh.

02:14:39.808 --> 02:14:42.143
- Jesus. - This guy is barely...

02:14:45.980 --> 02:14:47.397
105. Take him to the tent.

02:14:47.398 --> 02:14:48.440
Look at this guy.

02:14:48.441 --> 02:14:49.608
There's no treating this in the tent.

02:14:49.609 --> 02:14:51.026
105, he goes to the hot zone.

02:14:51.027 --> 02:14:52.069
Come on.

02:14:52.070 --> 02:14:53.530
This one's done anyways.

02:14:54.906 --> 02:14:56.156
Crazy.

02:14:56.157 --> 02:14:57.700
105. What do you want me to say, man?

02:15:03.164 --> 02:15:06.792
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God, Sheriff.

02:15:06.793 --> 02:15:09.628
Oh, my God, are you okay? Sheriff?

02:15:09.629 --> 02:15:11.797

it was hard to do what I had to do.

02:15:52.463 --> 02:15:54.256
But I had to do what I had to do,

02:15:54.257 --> 02:15:57.050
which we all have to do when it's our time to do it.

02:15:57.051 --> 02:15:59.469
So what do you think about Michelle, Big Mike?

02:15:59.470 --> 02:16:01.388
Do you think he's actually going to run for President

02:16:01.389 --> 02:16:03.140
or is he going to stick with his diet camps

02:16:03.141 --> 02:16:05.309
and keep talking about health foods

02:16:05.310 --> 02:16:07.854
instead of his husband's war crimes and drone warfare?

02:16:08.146 --> 02:16:09.564
What's up, Gainesville?

02:16:09.981 --> 02:16:11.982
New homeowner in town.

02:16:11.983 --> 02:16:14.860
New house, new us.

02:16:14.861 --> 02:16:16.654

02:16:29.876 --> 02:16:31.543
And when they broadcast the 18 gigahertz

02:16:31.544 --> 02:16:33.045
signal from the 5G system

02:16:33.046 --> 02:16:34.463
employed all across the world

02:16:34.464 --> 02:16:36.423
for one minute three different times as a pulse,

02:16:36.424 --> 02:16:38.258
it'll cause those lipid nanoparticles

02:16:38.259 --> 02:16:39.593
that are baked into the shots

02:16:39.594 --> 02:16:42.889
to swell and release those pathogenic contents.

02:16:43.473 --> 02:16:45.390
But today is about a major step forward

02:16:45.391 --> 02:16:47.809
in the tech industry here in New Mexico.

02:16:47.810 --> 02:16:49.186
And my son-in-law,

02:16:49.187 --> 02:16:51.229
the Mayor of Eddington, Mayor Cross,

02:16:51.230 --> 02:16:53.857
wants to take this opportunity

02:16:53.858 --> 02:16:58.320
to give a warm thanks to Solidgoldmagikarp

02:16:58.321 --> 02:17:00.030
for choosing as their home

02:17:00.031 --> 02:17:03.450
Sevilla County and Santa Lupe Pueblo,

02:17:03.451 --> 02:17:07.871
on whose shared land this data center now resides.

02:17:11.125 --> 02:17:13.961
We are now, both and together,

02:17:13.962 --> 02:17:17.714
one of the privileged places where the future is being built.

02:17:17.715 --> 02:17:19.257
And at this moment,

02:17:19.258 --> 02:17:20.968
when unheard of, wicked things

02:17:20.969 --> 02:17:23.261
are being perpetrated by our government...

02:17:23.262 --> 02:17:25.013
World Economic Forum,

02:17:25.014 --> 02:17:28.976
population control through disease and vaccine,

02:17:28.977 --> 02:17:30.519
with the people that created the virus

02:17:30.520 --> 02:17:32.396
now giving us the cure...

02:17:32.397 --> 02:17:34.565
All of us Useless Eaters.

02:17:35.316 --> 02:17:37.025
The opportunity at this dark moment

02:17:37.026 --> 02:17:40.779
to sculpt a brighter future is something to be cherished.

02:17:40.780 --> 02:17:42.239
And earned.

02:17:42.240 --> 02:17:46.994
We are now home to an advanced supercomputing infrastructure

02:17:46.995 --> 02:17:49.121
powering the future of a technology

02:17:49.122 --> 02:17:52.040
that will indeed change everything

02:17:52.041 --> 02:17:55.127
and solve problems we've never been able to solve

02:17:55.128 --> 02:17:58.588
and all the while using the least amount of energy and water

02:17:58.589 --> 02:18:00.674
as any data complex in the southwest!

02:18:00.675 --> 02:18:02.342
Sir. Sir, pardon me, sir.

02:18:02.343 --> 02:18:04.011
You do not have permission to film here.

02:18:04.012 --> 02:18:05.470
This is a private event.

02:18:05.471 --> 02:18:07.681
And that's because of what we're doing in solar.

02:18:07.682 --> 02:18:09.433
And what the Pueblo's doing, too!

02:18:09.434 --> 02:18:11.601
They got their new wind farm building up,

02:18:11.602 --> 02:18:17.149
taking part in New Mexico's 370-billion-dollar investment

02:18:17.150 --> 02:18:18.859
in renewable energy.

02:18:18.860 --> 02:18:24.322
Pushing advancements in wind, in solar, in geothermal,

02:18:24.323 --> 02:18:28.201
and soon the Governor's hoping to announce hydrogen, too!

02:18:45.428 --> 02:18:47.888
Plane hits a building, two buildings,

02:18:47.889 --> 02:18:49.681
they don't fall that way.

02:18:49.682 --> 02:18:51.558
That's how they go with controlled demolitions.

02:18:51.559 --> 02:18:53.393
You detonate the bottom.

02:19:00.068 --> 02:19:02.862
Why am I just noticing that you need a haircut?

02:19:09.202 --> 02:19:10.660
Did you have a good day?

02:19:10.661 --> 02:19:13.747
I did. I may have had a little too much to drink.

02:19:15.333 --> 02:19:19.044
There's never been a licensed MRNA vaccine

02:19:19.045 --> 02:19:22.589
and that ain't because there haven't been clinical trials.

02:19:22.590 --> 02:19:25.550
It's because there were significant adverse effects

02:19:25.551 --> 02:19:27.928
on the animals they tested it on.

02:19:27.929 --> 02:19:29.554
And the deepfake of Uncle Joe

02:19:29.555 --> 02:19:31.723
getting his jab is no contradiction.

02:19:31.724 --> 02:19:33.266
The man in the video had arms

02:19:33.267 --> 02:19:34.893
hairier than any ape.

02:19:34.894 --> 02:19:36.645
I'm surprised they didn't use

02:19:36.646 --> 02:19:39.523
their AI Picasso to fix those arms.

02:19:43.736 --> 02:19:44.821
I'm sorry.

02:19:45.822 --> 02:19:46.697
I'm sorry.

02:19:53.788 --> 02:19:56.040
I went a little too far with the blush.

02:20:31.701 --> 02:20:34.452
They have deprived you of your identity.

02:20:34.453 --> 02:20:36.997
And that deprivation and that slavery

02:20:36.998 --> 02:20:39.666
keeps you from being an agent of actual change,

02:20:39.667 --> 02:20:42.210
and it keeps them right where they are.

02:20:42.211 --> 02:20:43.296
Well, guess what?

02:20:43.921 --> 02:20:45.381
You are not alone.

02:20:46.591 --> 02:20:51.136
Guess what? Your pain is not a coincidence.

02:20:51.137 --> 02:20:53.180
You are not a coincidence.

02:20:53.181 --> 02:20:55.433
We are not a coincidence!

02:20:56.726 --> 02:20:58.144
Will you fight?

02:20:59.770 --> 02:21:00.855
I will!

02:21:01.814 --> 02:21:03.857
I'll do it for me as a child,

02:21:03.858 --> 02:21:06.109
and I'll do it for my future children,

02:21:06.110 --> 02:21:07.819
and I will do it for your children

02:21:07.820 --> 02:21:09.404
and your future children.

02:21:09.405 --> 02:21:11.489
And I will do it for their physical bodies

02:21:11.490 --> 02:21:13.658
and I will do it for their digital bodies.

02:21:13.659 --> 02:21:15.035
And I will win

02:21:15.036 --> 02:21:17.871
because I have fortified myself in Christ,

02:21:17.872 --> 02:21:20.457
and I'm talking about the Lord Christ, Jesus God!

02:21:20.458 --> 02:21:23.001
And with the Holy Spirit as our shield--
